         " Pre-strung with a synthetic gut for added convenience and value!The Head Graphene XT Speed S replaces the Graphene Speed S. Like it's predecessor, this update offers the benefits of the standard midplus version but in a slightly faster and more maneuverable package. The result is a racquet that should allow a wide range of intermediates to create effective pace and spin. With the addition of a stronger and lighter form of graphene in the shaft (called Graphene XT), Head is able to reposition even more weight to the grip and tip. The result is a racquet that offers smoother acceleration and easier access to power. With its near even balance, the Speed S has sufficient weight in the head to keep the racquet stable and comfortable against all but the heaviest levels of pace. From the baseline this racquet feels mobile and precise, with plenty of pop available to those who like to turn up the heat. At net the Speed S is fast enough for rapid exchanges but also quite stable for its weight class. Finally, aggressive serves should like how easily this stick whips through contact, a fact that should allow aggressive servers to dial up the pace and spin. With its fast feel, crisp response and controllable power, this version of the Speed S is a very solid option for intermediates who want solid performance from all areas of the court. ",

         " The Pure Drive is popular for a reason. Boasting an appeal that cuts across ability levels, this modern player's racquet offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, it’s also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T. For 2025, Babolat, enhances comfort with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat to smooth out harsh vibrations. This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolat’s HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus.\nThis model is version 11 ",

With its extended length, powerful beam construction, and open string pattern, the Pure Drive Plus gives aggressive players the ability to overwhelm their opponents with heavy pace. In addition to giving you extra leverage on groundies, this racquet’s extended length translates into an unmistakable boost in power on serves. Although not as nimble as the standard Pure Drive at net, this extended-length racquet comes around surprisingly fast in the front court, making it a formidable all-court weapon. For 2025, Babolat adds its NF2 Tech 2.0, which uses flax fibers in the throat to dampen harsh vibrations (a welcome feature, considering the stiff beam). This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the string bed to transfer more energy to the ball. Other features include Babolat’s HTR System, a layup strategy that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but creates more stability and less frame noodling on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, this update keeps a good thing going. Although you’ll appreciate the enhanced dampening and comfort, the star of the show remains its dangerous combination of power and spin. ",

         " The Pure Drive Team 2025 is defined by its user-friendly speed, easy power, and spin-friendly targeting. At only 10.6 ounces strung and boasting a sub-315 swingweight, this racquet, though not as stable as the standard Pure Drive, makes it easier for less advanced players to address the ball with confidence. It's also quite powerful, enabling players to overwhelm their opponents with higher levels of pace. For 2025, Babolat adds enhanced dampening with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a material technology that uses flax fibers in the throat and head to smooth out harsh vibrations (a welcome feature, considering the stiff beam). This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolat’s HTR System, a layup strategy that stiffens the hoop to further enhance power. Intermediate players looking for a light option with explosive power and spin-friendly targeting will love this one. ",

On the court, the Pure Drive Wimbledon offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, it's also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T.

This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolat's HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus. ",

Named the Pure Drive 98, this speedy racquet gives experienced players a dangerous combination of spin, power and precision. What separates it from the standard Pure Drive is a slightly smaller head size along with a thinner, more flexible beam. The upshot is a racquet that not only gives you a more \"connected feel\" but also delivers a more precise and predictable launch angle. For this update, Babolat reinforces the perimeter of the head with its HTR System, resulting in a more torsionally rigid construction for added stability and power. To help soak up the harsher vibrations, Babolat puts SWX Pure Feel in the shaft. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and extra RPMs (think heavy ball).  Ultimately, the Pure Drive 98 is a great option for experienced players who want a powerful and spin-friendly racquet with enough control to target the lines.  ",

         " Babolat adds another chapter to the most controlled and surgical member of the Pure Aero family. Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NF² Technology which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. With some nice updates to the response, the Pure Aero 98 delivers the spin and power of a modern player's racquet but with the control and feel needed to fully engage with your targets. BASED ON ADDITIONAL SAMPLES MEASURED, THE SWINGWEIGHT WAS LOWERED FROM 327 TO 321 ON 6.13.24.

At under 11 ounces strung, this stick makes it easy for intermediate players to load the ball with pace and spin. Like the heavier model endorsed by Nadal, the Pure Aero Rafa does not put a lot of technology between player and ball, resulting in a more \"connected feel\" at impact (think control). From the baseline, this stick is not only fast enough for whipping up spin or resetting the point with an outstretched flick, it also gives you the advantage of a near-even balance, which helps keep the racquet more stable (and comfortable) through impact. The user-friendly combination of speed and stability continues at net where the Pure Aero Rafa comes around fast to deliver a wonderfully solid feel for its weight class. In addition to Babolat's iconic Aeromodular Beam and Woofer Grommet system, this racquet comes with FSI Spin Technology, which features wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Rafa is not only perfect for the intermediate player looking to go on offense, it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker looking for a lighter spec with fewer tradeoffs in the stability department.   ",

         " Please note: this product is for 2 racquetsBabolat added another chapter to the Pure Strike 97 (formerly called the Pure Strike VS). Boasting the thinnest beam and most compact head in the Pure Strike family, this racquet delivers mindless accuracy on full cuts. It also moves extremely fast for its weight, making it great for whipping up spin, hitting shots on the run or reacting quickly at net. Compared to the previous generation, this update offers better pocketing along with a more plush feel off-center, especially in the upper hoop where the previous gen was a tad brassy. The Pure Strike 97 also comes with FSI Control technology, which tightens the string spacing for an even more precise and predictable trajectory. To help with comfort, Babolat adds NF² Tech which uses flax inserts in the shaft to help dampen harsh impact vibrations. Like the previous generation, this frame benefits from Control Frame Technology, which blends square and elliptical cross sections to deliver a stable hitting experience with excellent ball feedback. Ultimately, this racquet continues to be an obvious option for experienced players who want a speedy modern player's racquet with surgical targeting and great feel. The fact that it's even more comfortable than its predecessor is a nice bonus.  ",

As the lightest and fastest member of the Pure Strike family, this 10.7 ounce racquet is ideal for the intermediate player who wants controllable power, easy access to spin and great feel. Like the previous generation, it has a hybrid frame construction (called Control Frame Technology), which blends the control and feel of square beam with the speed and dynamism of a modern elliptical beam. This racquet also has FSI Power technology which features wider spacing between the upper cross strings for easier access to spin and pace. New to this frame is C2 Pure Feel, a material technology that combines cortex with a uniquely flexible viscoelastic rubber at 3/9 o'clock for added comfort and dwell time. On groundstrokes, the Pure Strike Team feels crisp, spin-friendly and accurate, with very predictable results on full swings. It's also quite fast, making it great for scrambling on defense or cranking winners on the run. The maneuverability continues on volleys and service returns where the Pure Strike Team glides into position with remarkable ease. As with the heavier Pure Strike models, the Team has great touch for hitting malicious droppers or working the ball into tight spaces. Ultimately, this is a great option for those who want a light and user-friendly performance racquet with easy targeting from all areas of the court. ",

         " The Pure Drive is popular for a reason. Boasting an appeal that cuts across ability levels, this modern player's racquet offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, it’s also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T. For 2025, Babolat, enhances comfort with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat to smooth out harsh vibrations. This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolat’s HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus.\nThis model is version 11 ",

With its extended length, powerful beam construction, and open string pattern, the Pure Drive Plus gives aggressive players the ability to overwhelm their opponents with heavy pace. In addition to giving you extra leverage on groundies, this racquet’s extended length translates into an unmistakable boost in power on serves. Although not as nimble as the standard Pure Drive at net, this extended-length racquet comes around surprisingly fast in the front court, making it a formidable all-court weapon. For 2025, Babolat adds its NF2 Tech 2.0, which uses flax fibers in the throat to dampen harsh vibrations (a welcome feature, considering the stiff beam). This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the string bed to transfer more energy to the ball. Other features include Babolat’s HTR System, a layup strategy that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but creates more stability and less frame noodling on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, this update keeps a good thing going. Although you’ll appreciate the enhanced dampening and comfort, the star of the show remains its dangerous combination of power and spin. ",

         " Updated with improved dampening for 2021, the Pure Drive 110 continues to be an obvious choice for any player who wants high comfort, easy power and raw speed. At under 10 ounces strung, this ultra maneuverable racquet is not only ideal for beginners, it should also tempt the senior doubles player who is looking to supercharge their serves, volleys and returns. In addition to its forgiving oversize head, this arm-friendly racquet has an extended 27.6\" length, resulting in extra leverage for loading the ball with power. Updated with Babolat's new HTR System, this racquet's graphite layup has been re-engineered for higher torsional rigidity, resulting in more efficient energy transfer to the ball. To help soak up harsher vibrations, Babolat has devoted more real estate in the Pure Drive's shaft to SWX Pure Feel, a thin and extremely flexible viscoelastic rubber that sits between the carbon layers. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and vicious RPMs (think heavy ball). On groundstrokes this racquet moves with lightning speed. It rewards medium length strokes with easy depth, and there is blistering power available on full swings. The large hitting area provides a nice margin of error, ensuring that comfort and power remain high even when contact is less than perfect. It also packs an open 16x19 string pattern with impressive spin-potential. As with the previous generation, this racquet shines at net. In addition to moving fast when the pressure is on, this racquet's large and stable hitting surface makes it easy to hit effective volleys. With its extended 27.6\" length, it not only hits lethal overheads, but it give you an undeniable power boost on serve. Ultimately, with some impressive tweaks to the feel, the Pure Drive 110 keeps getting better. Players looking for a fast, comfortable and powerful oversize racquet should start here. ",

At under 11 ounces strung, this stick makes it easy for intermediate players to load the ball with pace and spin.

From the baseline, this stick is not only fast enough for whipping up spin or resetting the point with an outstretched flick, it also gives you the advantage of a near-even balance, which helps keep the racquet more stable (and comfortable) through impact. The user-friendly combination of speed and stability continues at net where the Pure Aero Rafa comes around fast to deliver a wonderfully solid feel for its weight class. In addition to Babolat's iconic Aeromodular Beam and Woofer Grommet system, this racquet comes with FSI Spin Technology, which features wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Rafa is not only perfect for the intermediate player looking to go on offense, it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker looking for a lighter spec with fewer tradeoffs in the stability department.   ",

Other specs include a 330 swingweight, which not only keeps the racquet stable against higher levels of pace but also translates into impressive power on full cuts. For this update, Babolat adds FSI Control technology, which features tighter string spacing for an even more precise and predictable trajectory. To help with comfort, Babolat updates this racquet with NF2-Tech (flax fibers) in the shaft while keeping the head free of dampening agents to provide more direct ball feedback. As with previous generations, this frame benefits from Control Frame Technology, which blends square and elliptical cross sections to enhance stability and ball feedback. Ultimately, with subtle updates to the feel, the Pure Strike 98 16x19 remains a great option for experienced players looking for a stable racquet with controllable power and great feel.   ",

         " Babolat adds another chapter to its most control-oriented racquet. Like previous versions of the Pure Strike 98 18x20, this traditional player's racquet is defined by its dense string pattern and laser-like trajectory, making it great for driving the ball through the court. It also packs a 332 swingweight, which gives it excellent stability against heavy hitters while also rewarding strong players with enough mass-based pop to impose their will. For this update, Babolat adds FSI Control technology, which features tighter string spacing for an even more precise and predictable trajectory. To help with comfort, Babolat puts NF2-Tech (flax fibers) in the shaft while keeping the head free of dampening agents to provide more direct ball feedback. As with previous generations, this frame benefits from Control Frame Technology, which blends square and elliptical cross sections to enhance stability and ball feedback. Ultimately, with this update, Babolat keeps a good thing going. Experienced players looking for a stable racquet with phenomenal control will love this one.  ",

Like the previous generation, it has a hybrid frame construction (called Control Frame Technology), which blends the control and feel of square beam with the speed and dynamism of a modern elliptical beam. This racquet also has FSI Power technology which features wider spacing between the upper cross strings for easier access to spin and pace. New to this frame is C2 Pure Feel, a material technology that combines cortex with a uniquely flexible viscoelastic rubber at 3/9 o'clock for added comfort and dwell time. On groundstrokes, the Pure Strike Team feels crisp, spin-friendly and accurate, with very predictable results on full swings. It's also quite fast, making it great for scrambling on defense or cranking winners on the run. The maneuverability continues on volleys and service returns where the Pure Strike Team glides into position with remarkable ease. As with the heavier Pure Strike models, the Team has great touch for hitting malicious droppers or working the ball into tight spaces. Ultimately, this is a great option for those who want a light and user-friendly performance racquet with easy targeting from all areas of the court. ",
