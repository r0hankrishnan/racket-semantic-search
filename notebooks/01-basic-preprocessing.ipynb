    "# Racquet Features Cleaning Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the process of cleaning the raw tennis racquet listing data. Here is an overview of the changes made:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get rid of all junior racquets from df\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Drop all duplicated columns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Convert the following columns from object to float or int using regex or str logic:\n",
    "    - Head Size\n",
    "    - Length\n",
    "    - Strung Weight\n",
    "    - Balance\n",
    "        - Create two columns: racquet_balance_in and racquet_balance_HH_HL\n",
    "    - Stiffness\n",
    "    - Beam width\n",
    "    - String Pattern\n",
    "        - Create two columns: racquet_mains and racquet_crosses\n",
    "    - String Tension\n",
    "        - Create two columns: racquet_tension_lower and racquet_tension_upper'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these sections, I tried my best to pull out my df manipulation into custom functions. As I continue to learn about data science development, I am learning the importance of modular code, and systemitizing my work. The functions in this notebook have been pulled out and moved into the `preprocessing.py` modules in `src/data`."

         " The Pure Drive is popular for a reason. Boasting an appeal that cuts across ability levels, this modern player's racquet offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, it’s also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T. For 2025, Babolat, enhances comfort with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat to smooth out harsh vibrations. This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolat’s HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus.\nThis model is version 11 ",

         " Introducing the Pure Drive Wimbledon 2025! Featuring the same specs and playability as the standard version, this racquet's cosmetic is inspired by the green lawns of Wimbledon. On the court, the Pure Drive Wimbledon offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, it's also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T. Technologies include an updated version of NF2 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat to smooth out harsh vibrations. This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolat's HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus. ",

         " Updated with improved dampening for 2021, the Pure Drive 110 continues to be an obvious choice for any player who wants high comfort, easy power and raw speed. At under 10 ounces strung, this ultra maneuverable racquet is not only ideal for beginners, it should also tempt the senior doubles player who is looking to supercharge their serves, volleys and returns. In addition to its forgiving oversize head, this arm-friendly racquet has an extended 27.6\" length, resulting in extra leverage for loading the ball with power. Updated with Babolat's new HTR System, this racquet's graphite layup has been re-engineered for higher torsional rigidity, resulting in more efficient energy transfer to the ball. To help soak up harsher vibrations, Babolat has devoted more real estate in the Pure Drive's shaft to SWX Pure Feel, a thin and extremely flexible viscoelastic rubber that sits between the carbon layers. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and vicious RPMs (think heavy ball). On groundstrokes this racquet moves with lightning speed. It rewards medium length strokes with easy depth, and there is blistering power available on full swings. The large hitting area provides a nice margin of error, ensuring that comfort and power remain high even when contact is less than perfect. It also packs an open 16x19 string pattern with impressive spin-potential. As with the previous generation, this racquet shines at net. In addition to moving fast when the pressure is on, this racquet's large and stable hitting surface makes it easy to hit effective volleys. With its extended 27.6\" length, it not only hits lethal overheads, but it give you an undeniable power boost on serve. Ultimately, with some impressive tweaks to the feel, the Pure Drive 110 keeps getting better. Players looking for a fast, comfortable and powerful oversize racquet should start here. ",

At under 11 ounces strung, this stick makes it easy for intermediate players to load the ball with pace and spin. Like the heavier model endorsed by Nadal, the Pure Aero Rafa does not put a lot of technology between player and ball, resulting in a more \"connected feel\" at impact (think control). From the baseline, this stick is not only fast enough for whipping up spin or resetting the point with an outstretched flick, it also gives you the advantage of a near-even balance, which helps keep the racquet more stable (and comfortable) through impact. The user-friendly combination of speed and stability continues at net where the Pure Aero Rafa comes around fast to deliver a wonderfully solid feel for its weight class. In addition to Babolat's iconic Aeromodular Beam and Woofer Grommet system, this racquet comes with FSI Spin Technology, which features wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Rafa is not only perfect for the intermediate player looking to go on offense, it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker looking for a lighter spec with fewer tradeoffs in the stability department.   ",

Like previous generations, this update is made for players who want a control-oriented racquet that has enough pop to finish points. It also has more spin potential than its 18x20 counterpart, making it easier to execute the full range of angles and trajectories. Other specs include a 330 swingweight, which not only keeps the racquet stable against higher levels of pace but also translates into impressive power on full cuts. For this update, Babolat adds FSI Control technology, which features tighter string spacing for an even more precise and predictable trajectory. To help with comfort, Babolat updates this racquet with NF2-Tech (flax fibers) in the shaft while keeping the head free of dampening agents to provide more direct ball feedback. As with previous generations, this frame benefits from Control Frame Technology, which blends square and elliptical cross sections to enhance stability and ball feedback. Ultimately, with subtle updates to the feel, the Pure Strike 98 16x19 remains a great option for experienced players looking for a stable racquet with controllable power and great feel.   ",

This racquet has the same specs as the standard Boost Drive but comes in a beautiful white cosmetic. This racquet is ideal for beginners, rising juniors, and recreational players who want ease of use. With its ultra-maneuverable weight, the Boost Drive delivers very easy access to pace and spin. The generous 105 square inch head provides a nice margin of error, ensuring that power and comfort remain high even when contact is less than perfect. To further increase comfort and power, Babolat adds its time-tested Woofer grommet system to this racquet. The firm and aerodynamic beam provides this powerful stick with crisp precision, giving it impressive accuracy on full swings. From the baseline, the Boost Drive moves through the contact zone with amazing ease. Medium-length strokes deliver easy depth, while full cuts unlock blistering pace. Burgeoning topspin players will love the explosive acceleration and grippy 16x19 string pattern. At net, the 105-square-inch head provides a luxurious platform for blocking the ball back. The ultra light weight makes for effortless preparation, ensuring that the racquet comes around quickly when the pressure is on. There's also plenty of power to be had on serves, along with tons of action on slices. With the Boost Drive W, Babolat has delivered a great racquet to those who want high performance without breaking the bank. ",

Like the previous version, this racquet puts an open string pattern and powerful beam construction inside an extremely maneuverable package. For 2025, Dunlop widens the beam’s face at 3 and 9 o’clock to increase torsional stability and energy transfer. To help with comfort, Dunlop adds Vibroshield technology, a dampening material positioned in the shaft and head to minimize harsh impact vibrations. Dunlop also updates its Spin Boost XT grommets, which have been widened in the yoke to increase string movement for greater snapback and added ball rotation. As with the previous version, these grommets are strategically shaped and positioned to enhance spin across a wider range of impact locations. Additional technologies include Sonic Core Infinergy, a thermoplastic polyurethane in the upper hoop, to create a more comfortable and responsive feel at impact. Recommended to dedicated beginners and early intermediate players looking for an easy entry point into the world of aggressive tennis. ",

At roughly 10.6 ounces strung and boasting a very manageable swingweight, the SX 300 LS moves through contact with remarkable speed, making it easy to load the ball with heavy pace and spin. For 2025, Dunlop widens the beam’s face at 3 and 9 o’clock to increase torsional stability and energy transfer. To help with comfort, Dunlop adds Vibroshield technology, a dampening material positioned in the shaft and head to minimize harsh impact vibrations. Dunlop also updates its Spin Boost XT grommets, which have been widened in the yoke to increase string movement for greater snapback and added ball rotation. As with the previous version, these grommets are strategically shaped and positioned to enhance spin across a wider range of impact locations. Additional technologies include Sonic Core Infinergy, a thermoplastic polyurethane in the upper hoop, to create a more comfortable and responsive feel at impact. Intermediate players looking to play aggressive tennis will love this one. ",

         " Head adds another chapter to one of their most versatile player's racquets. It's called the Graphene 360+ Radical MP, and it specializes in easy targeting and great feel. For 2021, Head has not only added some extra weight and stability, they've also given this stick a lower, more arm-friendly flex rating. As with previous versions of the Radical MP, this racquet will appeal to a broad class of intermediate and advanced ball strikers. The signature technology is Graphene 360+, which combines the stability and easy power of Graphene 360 with SpiralFibers in the lower head to enhance feel. Like the previous generation this stick has a Control String Pattern, which includes denser main strings in the center for control along with wider spacing at the margins for a more forgiving feel off-center. On groundstrokes this racquet not only delivers that old school Radical feel, it also packs enough power and spin to put your opponent on defense. In addition to giving you the stability and plow-through to redirect heavier pace, this stick is also fast enough for whipping up spin or cranking winners on the run. The Radical MP also shines at net where it comes around fast to deliver a solid feel with great touch. On serves, power comes surprisingly easy, and there is enough spin-potential to hit effective slices and kickers. Ultimately, Head has produced a very impressive update to the Radical MP. Experienced players looking for a fast yet stable racquet with controllable power should add this to their demo list. \nSwingweight changed from 326 to 321 based on additional samples measured ",

At 10.8 ounces strung, the Twistpower is weighted for intermediates, but it also has enough stability to tempt the savvy veteran who is in the market for explosive speed. Unlike many of its competitors in the sub 11 ounce weight class, the Twistpower X100 has uniquely good feel and pocketing. The great feel comes in part from a twisted shaft design which helps the racquet bend optimally at impact. On groundstrokes the Twistpower moves through contact with remarkable ease, making it great for whipping up power or cranking winners on the run. Control is excellent thanks in part to its 16x18 string pattern, which delivers the kind of spin-potential that brings the ball down hard. At net the Twistpower delivers impressive touch for a light racquet, and the raw speed makes it perfect for reaction volleys or springing into action when opportunity knocks. This stick also shines on serve where it explodes powerfully through contact to deliver juicy levels of spin and slices that curve hard. Ultimately, the Prince Twistpower X100 is an impressive addition to the Prince racquet line-up. The combination of speed, spin, power and precision makes this an obvious choice for any intermediate player who is looking for a user-friendly modern player's racquet.  ",

At nearly 11.8 ounces strung and boasting a mid 320's RDC-swingweight, the Black Ace 315 feels a tad more stable than the 300 gram version, but it still packs enough speed for the aggressive all-court player. As part of the new Ace Station series, this racquet's synchronized technologies are designed to deliver more control and feel than racquets in the Q+ and QuadFocus lines (both more power oriented). In addition to its time-tested Kinetic Technology, which uses movable mass to increase stability and power, the Black Ace features FlexLogic to help the racquet bend optimally at impact. The upshot, according to ProKennex, is reduced head deformation at impact combined with increased dwell time, giving the shot-maker heightened command over the ball. Other notable technologies include a Kinetic Comfort Handle System which reduces harsh vibrations for a cleaner feel at impact. From the baseline the Black Ace 315 combines outstanding ball feedback with very easy targeting on full swings. It comes around fast for the weight while managing to feel stable against higher levels of pace. It's also very spin-friendly, and the touch on volleys is spot on. Aggressive servers will have enough control to swing for power. With its impressive combination of stability, precision and feel, the Black Ace 315 is an obvious choice for experienced players. ",

The crisp feel and excellent control help with targeting, and Babolat's time-tested Woofer grommet system makes for a smooth and lively response.

The speedy feel is also an asset on serves where this stick whips very easily though contact.

At 11.2 ounces strung and boasting a zippy sub-325 swingweight, this stick delivers easy acceleration from the baseline and quick handling at net. It also possesses the kind of spin-friendly precision and raw power that is dangerous in the hands of aggressive players. For 2022, in addition to a more arm-friendly flex point, Babolat adds comfort with NF² Technology, which uses flax inserts in the handle and upper hoop to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. Intermediate and advanced players looking for a speedy spin-monster with surgical targeting will love this update. \nSwingweight updated on 2.28.25 based on additional samples measured\n ",

         " Babolat adds another chapter to the most controlled and surgical member of the Pure Aero family. Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NF² Technology which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. With some nice updates to the response, the Pure Aero 98 delivers the spin and power of a modern player's racquet but with the control and feel needed to fully engage with your targets. BASED ON ADDITIONAL SAMPLES MEASURED, THE SWINGWEIGHT WAS LOWERED FROM 327 TO 321 ON 6.13.24.

Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NF² Technology which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. With some nice updates to the response, the Pure Aero 98 delivers the spin and power of a modern player's racquet but with the control and feel needed to fully engage with your targets.  ",

Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and vicious RPMs (think heavy ball). On groundstrokes this racquet moves with lightning speed. It rewards medium length strokes with easy depth, and there is blistering power available on full swings. The large hitting area provides a nice margin of error, ensuring that comfort and power remain high even when contact is less than perfect. It also packs an open 16x19 string pattern with impressive spin-potential. As with the previous generation, this racquet shines at net. In addition to moving fast when the pressure is on, this racquet's large and stable hitting surface makes it easy to hit effective volleys.

Boasting a maneuverable weight, the EVO Strike is perfect for beginner and intermediate players. In addition to its easy acceleration and spin-friendly string pattern, it features a 102 square-inch head, making it slightly more forgiving than a standard 100 square-inch frame. Technologies include a hybrid frame construction (called Control Frame Technology), which blends the control and feel of a square beam with the speed and dynamism of a modern elliptical beam. It also benefits from EVO Feel which is a special material compound designed to increase shock absorption and comfort. From the baseline, this racquet's accuracy inspires confidence on full swings. This racquet's raw speed not only makes it easier to generate pace and spin, but it will help you hit effective shots on the run. The maneuverable weight also comes in handy at net where this stick comes around fast to deliver impressive stability and comfort for the weight. With the Strike EVO, Babolat has delivered extremely impressive performance for the price. Bargain hunters looking for a user-friendly hitting experience will love this one. ",

         " Introducing the Pure Aero Rafa the lighter, faster companion to the Rafa Origin. At under 11 ounces strung, this stick makes it easy for intermediate players to load the ball with pace and spin. Like the heavier model endorsed by Nadal, the Pure Aero Rafa does not put a lot of technology between player and ball, resulting in a more \"connected feel\" at impact (think control). From the baseline, this stick is not only fast enough for whipping up spin or resetting the point with an outstretched flick, it also gives you the advantage of a near-even balance, which helps keep the racquet more stable (and comfortable) through impact. The user-friendly combination of speed and stability continues at net where the Pure Aero Rafa comes around fast to deliver a wonderfully solid feel for its weight class. In addition to Babolat's iconic Aeromodular Beam and Woofer Grommet system, this racquet comes with FSI Spin Technology, which features wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Rafa is not only perfect for the intermediate player looking to go on offense, it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker looking for a lighter spec with fewer tradeoffs in the stability department.   ",

         " Dunlop makes big changes to the CX 200 OS for 2024 while keeping the user-friendly playability and great feel of the previous generation. Boasting a forgiving 105 square inch head and open 16x19 string pattern the CX 200 OS combines arm-friendly comfort and easy power with spin-friendly precision. It also packs a 21.5 mm box beam, giving it impressive control and feel compared to its competitors. Weighing roughly 10.9 ounces strung, the CX 200 OS is weighted for rising intermediates, but it also packs a near 320 RDC swingweight, making it attractive to more advanced ball strikers, especially if they crave the advantages of a larger head size with a big spin window. For this update, Dunlop retools the beam, adding more of a box shape below the 10/2 axis to enhance stability, control and feel. Additional changes for 2024 include Powergrid Stringtech+, which features wider cross-string spacing to enhance spin and power. Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part of the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power. Ultimately, with some nice updates to the feel and response, this racquet remains a great option for the intermediate player who wants a more forgiving and powerful midplus racquet. Specs based on 1 sample ",

         " Introducing the most stable and surgical member of the SX family. It's called the SX 300 Tour, and it combines a control-oriented 98-square-inch head with a dangerous combination of power and spin (think heavy ball). In addition to its open string pattern, the SX Tour features a firm and stable beam construction, making it easier to keep your opponent in check with high levels of pace. It also features a sub-325 swingweight, giving experienced players explosive acceleration from the baseline and speedy handling at net. For 2025, Dunlop widens the beam's face at 3 and 9 o'clock to increase torsional stability and energy transfer. To help with comfort, Dunlop adds Vibroshield technology, a dampening material positioned in the shaft and head to minimize harsh impact vibrations. Dunlop also updates its Spin Boost XT Grommets, which have been widened in the yoke to increase string movement for greater snapback and added ball rotation. As with the previous version, these grommets are strategically shaped and positioned to enhance spin across a wider range of impact locations. Additional technologies include Sonic Core Infinergy, a thermoplastic polyurethane in the upper hoop, to create a more comfortable and responsive feel at impact. Ultimately, the SX 300 Tour continues to be an outstanding option for those who want a powerful weapon with enough spin potential to bring the ball down on a dime.  ",
