At 11.2 ounces strung and boasting a zippy sub-325 swingweight, this stick delivers easy acceleration from the baseline and quick handling at net. It also possesses the kind of spin-friendly precision and raw power that is dangerous in the hands of aggressive players. For 2022, in addition to a more arm-friendly flex point, Babolat adds comfort with NF² Technology, which uses flax inserts in the handle and upper hoop to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. Intermediate and advanced players looking for a speedy spin-monster with surgical targeting will love this update. \nSwingweight updated on 2.28.25 based on additional samples measured\n ",

         " Babolat adds another chapter to the most controlled and surgical member of the Pure Aero family. Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NF² Technology which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. With some nice updates to the response, the Pure Aero 98 delivers the spin and power of a modern player's racquet but with the control and feel needed to fully engage with your targets. BASED ON ADDITIONAL SAMPLES MEASURED, THE SWINGWEIGHT WAS LOWERED FROM 327 TO 321 ON 6.13.24.

What separates it, however, is an extended 27.5\" length, which translates into extra pop on groundies and serves.

Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NF² Technology which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. With some nice updates to the response, the Pure Aero 98 delivers the spin and power of a modern player's racquet but with the control and feel needed to fully engage with your targets.  ",

Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and vicious RPMs (think heavy ball). On groundstrokes this racquet moves with lightning speed. It rewards medium length strokes with easy depth, and there is blistering power available on full swings. The large hitting area provides a nice margin of error, ensuring that comfort and power remain high even when contact is less than perfect. It also packs an open 16x19 string pattern with impressive spin-potential. As with the previous generation, this racquet shines at net. In addition to moving fast when the pressure is on, this racquet's large and stable hitting surface makes it easy to hit effective volleys.

         " This racquet comes pre-strung with a comfortable synthetic gut for added value!With its user-friendly performance and great price, the EVO Strike is ideal for bargain hunters or anyone who wants an affordable racquet with a very easy learning curve. Boasting a maneuverable weight, the EVO Strike is perfect for beginner and intermediate players. In addition to its easy acceleration and spin-friendly string pattern, it features a 102 square-inch head, making it slightly more forgiving than a standard 100 square-inch frame. Technologies include a hybrid frame construction (called Control Frame Technology), which blends the control and feel of a square beam with the speed and dynamism of a modern elliptical beam. It also benefits from EVO Feel which is a special material compound designed to increase shock absorption and comfort. From the baseline, this racquet's accuracy inspires confidence on full swings. This racquet's raw speed not only makes it easier to generate pace and spin, but it will help you hit effective shots on the run. The maneuverable weight also comes in handy at net where this stick comes around fast to deliver impressive stability and comfort for the weight. With the Strike EVO, Babolat has delivered extremely impressive performance for the price. Bargain hunters looking for a user-friendly hitting experience will love this one. ",

         " Introducing the Pure Aero Rafa the lighter, faster companion to the Rafa Origin. At under 11 ounces strung, this stick makes it easy for intermediate players to load the ball with pace and spin. Like the heavier model endorsed by Nadal, the Pure Aero Rafa does not put a lot of technology between player and ball, resulting in a more \"connected feel\" at impact (think control). From the baseline, this stick is not only fast enough for whipping up spin or resetting the point with an outstretched flick, it also gives you the advantage of a near-even balance, which helps keep the racquet more stable (and comfortable) through impact. The user-friendly combination of speed and stability continues at net where the Pure Aero Rafa comes around fast to deliver a wonderfully solid feel for its weight class. In addition to Babolat's iconic Aeromodular Beam and Woofer Grommet system, this racquet comes with FSI Spin Technology, which features wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Rafa is not only perfect for the intermediate player looking to go on offense, it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker looking for a lighter spec with fewer tradeoffs in the stability department.   ",

Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part of the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy, a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power.

         " Dunlop makes big changes to the CX 200 OS for 2024 while keeping the user-friendly playability and great feel of the previous generation. Boasting a forgiving 105 square inch head and open 16x19 string pattern the CX 200 OS combines arm-friendly comfort and easy power with spin-friendly precision. It also packs a 21.5 mm box beam, giving it impressive control and feel compared to its competitors. Weighing roughly 10.9 ounces strung, the CX 200 OS is weighted for rising intermediates, but it also packs a near 320 RDC swingweight, making it attractive to more advanced ball strikers, especially if they crave the advantages of a larger head size with a big spin window. For this update, Dunlop retools the beam, adding more of a box shape below the 10/2 axis to enhance stability, control and feel. Additional changes for 2024 include Powergrid Stringtech+, which features wider cross-string spacing to enhance spin and power. Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part of the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power. Ultimately, with some nice updates to the feel and response, this racquet remains a great option for the intermediate player who wants a more forgiving and powerful midplus racquet. Specs based on 1 sample ",

         " Introducing the most stable and surgical member of the SX family. It's called the SX 300 Tour, and it combines a control-oriented 98-square-inch head with a dangerous combination of power and spin (think heavy ball). In addition to its open string pattern, the SX Tour features a firm and stable beam construction, making it easier to keep your opponent in check with high levels of pace. It also features a sub-325 swingweight, giving experienced players explosive acceleration from the baseline and speedy handling at net. For 2025, Dunlop widens the beam's face at 3 and 9 o'clock to increase torsional stability and energy transfer. To help with comfort, Dunlop adds Vibroshield technology, a dampening material positioned in the shaft and head to minimize harsh impact vibrations. Dunlop also updates its Spin Boost XT Grommets, which have been widened in the yoke to increase string movement for greater snapback and added ball rotation. As with the previous version, these grommets are strategically shaped and positioned to enhance spin across a wider range of impact locations. Additional technologies include Sonic Core Infinergy, a thermoplastic polyurethane in the upper hoop, to create a more comfortable and responsive feel at impact. Ultimately, the SX 300 Tour continues to be an outstanding option for those who want a powerful weapon with enough spin potential to bring the ball down on a dime.  ",

Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and vicious RPMs (think heavy ball).On groundstrokes this racquet moves with lightning speed. It rewards medium length strokes with easy depth, and there is blistering power available on full swings. The large hitting area provides a nice margin of error, ensuring that comfort and power remain high even when contact is less than perfect. It also packs an open 16x19 string pattern with impressive spin-potential. As with the previous generation, this racquet shines at net. In addition to moving fast when the pressure is on, this racquet's large and stable hitting surface makes it easy to hit effective volleys.

Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part of the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power. Experienced players looking for a user-friendly midsize player's racquet should give this update a serious look. \nRacquet Composition: Sonic Core Infinergy/Graphite\nRacquet Power Level: Low-Medium\nRacquet Stroke Style: Medium-Full\nRacquet Swing Speed: Medium-Fast\nRacquet Colors: Red\nRacquet Grip Type: Dunlop Viper Dry\n"
