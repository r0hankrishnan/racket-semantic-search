At 11.2 ounces strung and boasting a zippy sub-325 swingweight, this stick delivers easy acceleration from the baseline and quick handling at net. It also possesses the kind of spin-friendly precision and raw power that is dangerous in the hands of aggressive players. For 2022, in addition to a more arm-friendly flex point, Babolat adds comfort with NF² Technology, which uses flax inserts in the handle and upper hoop to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin.

Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NF² Technology which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. With some nice updates to the response, the Pure Aero 98 delivers the spin and power of a modern player's racquet but with the control and feel needed to fully engage with your targets. BASED ON ADDITIONAL SAMPLES MEASURED, THE SWINGWEIGHT WAS LOWERED FROM 327 TO 321 ON 6.13.24.

Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NF² Technology which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. With some nice updates to the response, the Pure Aero 98 delivers the spin and power of a modern player's racquet but with the control and feel needed to fully engage with your targets.  ",

It also benefits from EVO Feel which is a special material compound designed to increase shock absorption and comfort. From the baseline, this racquet's accuracy inspires confidence on full swings. This racquet's raw speed not only makes it easier to generate pace and spin, but it will help you hit effective shots on the run. The maneuverable weight also comes in handy at net where this stick comes around fast to deliver impressive stability and comfort for the weight.

         " Introducing the Pure Aero Rafa the lighter, faster companion to the Rafa Origin. At under 11 ounces strung, this stick makes it easy for intermediate players to load the ball with pace and spin. Like the heavier model endorsed by Nadal, the Pure Aero Rafa does not put a lot of technology between player and ball, resulting in a more \"connected feel\" at impact (think control). From the baseline, this stick is not only fast enough for whipping up spin or resetting the point with an outstretched flick, it also gives you the advantage of a near-even balance, which helps keep the racquet more stable (and comfortable) through impact. The user-friendly combination of speed and stability continues at net where the Pure Aero Rafa comes around fast to deliver a wonderfully solid feel for its weight class. In addition to Babolat's iconic Aeromodular Beam and Woofer Grommet system, this racquet comes with FSI Spin Technology, which features wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Rafa is not only perfect for the intermediate player looking to go on offense, it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker looking for a lighter spec with fewer tradeoffs in the stability department.   ",

         " The CX 200 LS puts the outstanding control and feel of the CX series into a light and user-friendly package. As with the heavier CX 200, this racquet combines a 98 square inch head with an open 16x19 string pattern and flexible 21.5mm box beam. As such, it's perfect for the rising intermediate player who wants a very speedy racquet with controllable power and great feel. For this update, Dunlop retools the beam, adding more of a box shape below the 10/2 axis to enhance stability, control and feel. Additional changes for 2024 include Powergrid Stringtech+, which features wider cross-string spacing to enhance spin and power. Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part of the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy, a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power. Ultimately, with its easy acceleration, great feel and controllable power, this is the perfect option for the improving player who wants the precision of a player's racquet without all the bulk. ",

         " Dunlop gives intermediate players an easier path to power and spin. Like the previous generation, this 2025 update to the SX 300 LS is defined by speed, power, and spin. At roughly 10.6 ounces strung and boasting a very manageable swingweight, the SX 300 LS moves through contact with remarkable speed, making it easy to load the ball with heavy pace and spin. For 2025, Dunlop widens the beam’s face at 3 and 9 o’clock to increase torsional stability and energy transfer. To help with comfort, Dunlop adds Vibroshield technology, a dampening material positioned in the shaft and head to minimize harsh impact vibrations. Dunlop also updates its Spin Boost XT grommets, which have been widened in the yoke to increase string movement for greater snapback and added ball rotation. As with the previous version, these grommets are strategically shaped and positioned to enhance spin across a wider range of impact locations. Additional technologies include Sonic Core Infinergy, a thermoplastic polyurethane in the upper hoop, to create a more comfortable and responsive feel at impact. Intermediate players looking to play aggressive tennis will love this one. ",

         " Introducing the most stable and surgical member of the SX family. It's called the SX 300 Tour, and it combines a control-oriented 98-square-inch head with a dangerous combination of power and spin (think heavy ball). In addition to its open string pattern, the SX Tour features a firm and stable beam construction, making it easier to keep your opponent in check with high levels of pace. It also features a sub-325 swingweight, giving experienced players explosive acceleration from the baseline and speedy handling at net. For 2025, Dunlop widens the beam's face at 3 and 9 o'clock to increase torsional stability and energy transfer.

Ultimately, the SX 300 Tour continues to be an outstanding option for those who want a powerful weapon with enough spin potential to bring the ball down on a dime.  ",

As with the previous generation, the FX 500 Lite benefits from Sonic Core w/Infinergy, which is added to the upper hoop to soften the feel of impact.

For 2023, Babolat updates the feel with NF Technology which includes flax inserts in the handle for a softer feel at impact. Comfort is further enhanced by SWX Pure Feel at 3/9 o'clock in the racquet's head. This racquet also benefits from FSI Spin Technology which features wider spacing between the crosses for a tighter grip on the ball. With some impressive updates to the feel and string bed, the Pure Aero Light continues to be an obvious option for improving players who are looking to rise to next level. \nRacquet Composition: Graphite\nRacquet Power Level: Low-Medium\nRacquet Stroke Style: Medium-Full\nRacquet Swing Speed: Medium-Fast\nRacquet Colors: Yellow, Grey, White\nRacquet Grip Type: Babolat Syntec Pro\n"

         " Babolat updates the feel and string bed of one of the game's best extended length racquets. It's called the Pure Aero Plus and it gives experienced ball strikers the ability to hit a very heavy ball. Like the standard Pure Aero, this stick combines a powerful tapered beam with a spin-friendly 16x19 string pattern. What separates it, however, is an extended 27.5\" length, which translates into extra pop on groundies and serves. For 2023, in addition to a softer, more arm-friendly flex point, Babolat adds comfort with NF² Technology which uses flax inserts in the handle and upper hoop to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. Ultimately, by combining impressive power with spin-friendly precision, Babolat has delivered a dangerous weapon to experienced players. The softer feel for 2023 is a nice touch. ",

Compared to a standard 100 square inch racquet, the EVO Aero Lite Pink packs a slightly larger hitting surface, resulting in a more forgiving and user-friendly hitting experience. Thanks to a low stiffness level, the EVO Aero Lite Pink is also great for those who want an arm-friendly ride. Ultimately, the EVO Aero Lite Pink not only offers user-friendly performance to improving players, it's also an outstanding value. \nRacquet Composition: Graphite\nRacquet Power Level: Low-Medium\nRacquet Stroke Style: Medium-Full\nRacquet Swing Speed: Medium-Fast\nRacquet Colors: White/Pink/Grey\nRacquet Grip Type: Babolat Syntec EVO\n"

For 2025, Babolat adds comfort with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat and head to smooth out harsh vibrations (a welcome feature, considering the stiff beam). This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolat’s HTR System, a layup strategy that stiffens the hoop to further enhance power. Ultimately, with some nice updates to the comfort, the 2025 Pure Drive Lite checks all the right boxes. Rising players looking to develop into aggressive ball strikers will find this one perfect. \nRacquet Composition: Graphite\nRacquet Power Level: Low-Medium\nRacquet Stroke Style: Medium-Full\nRacquet Swing Speed: Medium-Fast\nRacquet Colors: Blue\nRacquet Grip Type: Babolat Syntec Pro\n"

In addition to giving you extra leverage on groundies, this racquet’s extended length translates into an unmistakable boost in power on serves.

Additional changes for 2024 include Powergrid Stringtechplus, which features wider cross-string spacing to enhance spin and power. Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part of the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power. Ultimately, with some incremental tweaks to the feel and response, the 400 Tour continues to be a great option for intermediate and advanced players looking for a speedy and spin-friendly modern player's racquet with above average comfort and feel. \nRacquet Composition: Sonic Core Infinergy/Graphite\nRacquet Power Level: Low-Medium\nRacquet Stroke Style: Medium-Full\nRacquet Swing Speed: Medium-Fast\nRacquet Colors: Red\nRacquet Grip Type: Dunlop Viper Dry\n"

With this racquet Babolat gives beginners and recreational players the perfect tool for generating spin and power. At under 10 ounces strung, this stick is extremely maneuverable, making it easier for less advanced players to achieve effective contact with the ball. This racquet also gives you the advantage of an open 16x18 string pattern, making it easy to load the ball with spin. Compared to a standard 100 square inch racquet, the EVO Aero Lite Pink packs a slightly larger hitting surface, resulting in a more forgiving and user-friendly hitting experience. Thanks to a low stiffness level, the EVO Aero Lite Pink is also great for those who want an arm-friendly ride.

Like the previous generation, this racquet combines a 98 square inch head with a flexible 21.5mm box beam and 16x19 string pattern. The result is a racquet that combines spin-friendly precision with outstanding ball feedback. It's also extremely fast, making it great for hitting shots on the run, whipping up extra spin or reacting quickly at net. For this update, Dunlop retools the beam, adding more of a box shape below the 10/2 axis to enhance stability, control and feel. Additional changes for 2024 include Powergrid Stringtechplus, which features wider cross-string spacing to enhance spin and power. Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part of the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power. Ultimately, the CX 200 is a great option for those who want a classic control racquet with some modern spin and speed.Based on additional samples measured, the swingweight was changed to 308 on 3.11.24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                    |\n",

      "|                 |                            |                  |                 | Racquet Description:  Dunlop makes big changes to the CX 200 OS for 2024 while keeping the user-friendly playability and great feel of the previous generation. Boasting a forgiving 105 square inch head and open 16x19 string pattern the CX 200 OS combines arm-friendly comfort and easy power with spin-friendly precision. It also packs a 21.5 mm box beam, giving it impressive control and feel compared to its competitors. Weighing roughly 10.9 ounces strung, the CX 200 OS is weighted for rising intermediates, but it also packs a near 320 RDC swingweight, making it attractive to more advanced ball strikers, especially if they crave the advantages of a larger head size with a big spin window. For this update, Dunlop retools the beam, adding more of a box shape below the 10/2 axis to enhance stability, control and feel. Additional changes for 2024 include Powergrid Stringtechplus, which features wider cross-string spacing to enhance spin and power. Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part of the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power.

As with the heavier CX 200, this racquet combines a 98 square inch head with an open 16x19 string pattern and flexible 21.5mm box beam. As such, it's perfect for the rising intermediate player who wants a very speedy racquet with controllable power and great feel. For this update, Dunlop retools the beam, adding more of a box shape below the 10/2 axis to enhance stability, control and feel. Additional changes for 2024 include Powergrid Stringtechplus, which features wider cross-string spacing to enhance spin and power. Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part of the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy, a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power.

Like the previous generation, this racquet combines modern spin and speed with classic control and feel. Defined by its compact 95 square inch head and 16x19 string pattern, this racquet rewards powerful strokes with pinpoint accuracy. In addition to offering easier spin and depth than its 18x20 counterpart, the CX 200 Tour 16x19 comes with a flexible 20.5mm beam, giving it outstanding ball feedback. For this update, Dunlop retools the beam, adding more of a box shape below the 10/2 axis to enhance stability, control and feel. Additional changes for 2024 include Powergrid Stringtechplus, which features wider cross-string spacing to enhance spin and power. Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part of the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power.

Defined by its compact 95 square inch head and flexible 20.5mm beam, the CX 200 Tour 18x20 offers laser-like precision from the baseline and outstanding touch at net. As with the previous generation, this racquet's manageable swingweight makes it one of the most user-friendly members of its class. For this update, Dunlop retools the beam, adding more of a box shape below the 10/2 axis to enhance stability, control and feel. Additional changes for 2024 include Powergrid Stringtechplus, which features wider cross string spacing to enhance spin and power. Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part for the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy, a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power. With this update, Dunlop keeps a good thing going.

Featuring the same specs as the standard cosmetic, this racquet specializes in comfort and controllable power. It's also extremely fast. As such, it gives improving intermediate players the perfect tool for mastering stroke mechanics and rising to the next level. Like other members of the Boom family, this racquet features a unique head shape, which creates a more forgiving contact zone along with a larger spin window. The result is a more comfortable and spin-friendly hitting experience. Notable technologies include Auxetic 2, a uniquely flexible material in the yoke and handle to optimize the response. Other technologies include a Morph Beam, which blends box and angular cross sections to combine classic control and feel with impressive stability and power. The Boom MP also features Graphene 360plus (labeled Graphene Inside), which strengthens the frame in key locations to enhance stability and power. Ultimately, with this new addition to the Boom family, Head gives improving players a very impressive combination of comfort, power, spin, and speed.

Like the 2022 model it replaces, this racquet features the thinnest beam and most surgical head size in the Black Ace franchise. It also packs one of the softest, most flexible beams this side of the wood era, giving it the kind of buttery feedback that is rare for a modern racquet. For 2025, the layup gets updated with a groundbreaking Aurealian carbon weave, resulting in a more consistent response while also enabling tighter manufacturing tolerances. Complementing this innovation is FlexLogic, allowing the racquet to bend in ways that enhance dwell time, pocketing, and feel. This racquet also benefits from ProKennex's legendary Kinetic System, which places movable mass at 3 and 9 o'clock in the head to boost stability and comfort. Additionally, it features a Kinetic Comfort Cap, a handle technology that minimizes harsh impact vibrations. These time-tested Kinetic technologies offer one of the most arm-friendly hitting experiences available. Ultimately, the Black Ace Pro is an outstanding option for experienced players looking for the ultimate in control and feel.

At 11.2 ounces strung and boasting a zippy sub-325 swingweight, this stick delivers easy acceleration from the baseline and quick handling at net. It also possesses the kind of spin-friendly precision and raw power that is dangerous in the hands of aggressive players. For 2022, in addition to a more arm-friendly flex point, Babolat adds comfort with NF² Technology, which uses flax inserts in the handle and upper hoop to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. Intermediate and advanced players looking for a speedy spin-monster with surgical targeting will love this update. Swingweight updated on 2.28.25 based on additional samples measured"

The racquet has a 321.0 ounce swing weight, a 98.0 square inch head size, a 11.4 ounce strung weight, and has a 16.0 by 20.0 string pattern. The racquet has a tension range of 50.0 pounds (lbs) to 59.0 pounds (lbs). The racquet has an average beam width of 22.0, with a 12.79 inch balance point, and is 6.0 head heavy. The racquet has a Black/Yellow colorway and has a price of 299.0 dollars. Here is the marketing blurb for the Babolat Pure Aero 98 2023: Babolat adds another chapter to the most controlled and surgical member of the Pure Aero family. Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NF² Technology which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. With some nice updates to the response, the Pure Aero 98 delivers the spin and power of a modern player's racquet but with the control and feel needed to fully engage with your targets. BASED ON ADDITIONAL SAMPLES MEASURED, THE SWINGWEIGHT WAS LOWERED FROM 327 TO 321 ON 6.13.24."

         "The Dunlop SX 300 LS is a unkown powered racquet designed for players with unkown strokes and unkown swings. It features a stiffness rating of nan and a nan composition. The racquet has a nan ounce swing weight, a nan square inch head size, a nan ounce strung weight, and has a nan by nan string pattern. The racquet has a tension range of nan pounds (lbs) to nan pounds (lbs). The racquet has an average beam width of nan, with a nan inch balance point, and is nan equally balanced. The racquet has a nan colorway and has a price of 249.99 dollars. Here is the marketing blurb for the Dunlop SX 300 LS: Dunlop gives intermediate players an easier path to power and spin. Like the previous generation, this 2025 update to the SX 300 LS is defined by speed, power, and spin. At roughly 10.6 ounces strung and boasting a very manageable swingweight, the SX 300 LS moves through contact with remarkable speed, making it easy to load the ball with heavy pace and spin. For 2025, Dunlop widens the beam’s face at 3 and 9 o’clock to increase torsional stability and energy transfer. To help with comfort, Dunlop adds Vibroshield technology, a dampening material positioned in the shaft and head to minimize harsh impact vibrations. Dunlop also updates its Spin Boost XT grommets, which have been widened in the yoke to increase string movement for greater snapback and added ball rotation. As with the previous version, these grommets are strategically shaped and positioned to enhance spin across a wider range of impact locations. Additional technologies include Sonic Core Infinergy, a thermoplastic polyurethane in the upper hoop, to create a more comfortable and responsive feel at impact. Intermediate players looking to play aggressive tennis will love this one."

It's called the SX 300 Tour, and it combines a control-oriented 98-square-inch head with a dangerous combination of power and spin (think heavy ball). In addition to its open string pattern, the SX Tour features a firm and stable beam construction, making it easier to keep your opponent in check with high levels of pace. It also features a sub-325 swingweight, giving experienced players explosive acceleration from the baseline and speedy handling at net. For 2025, Dunlop widens the beam's face at 3 and 9 o'clock to increase torsional stability and energy transfer.

Like the previous generation, this racquet combines a 98 square inch head with a flexible 21.5mm box beam and 16x19 string pattern. The result is a racquet that combines spin-friendly precision with outstanding ball feedback. It's also extremely fast, making it great for hitting shots on the run, whipping up extra spin or reacting quickly at net. For this update, Dunlop retools the beam, adding more of a box shape below the 10/2 axis to enhance stability, control and feel. Additional changes for 2024 include Powergrid Stringtech+, which features wider cross-string spacing to enhance spin and power. Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part of the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power. Ultimately, the CX 200 is a great option for those who want a classic control racquet with some modern spin and speed.Based on additional samples measured, the swingweight was changed to 308 on 3.11.24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |           0.204634 |\n",

For 2022, Babolat updates the feel with NF² Technology which includes flax inserts in the handle for a softer feel at impact. Comfort is further enhanced by SWX Pure Feel at 3/9 o'clock in the racquet's head. This racquet also benefits from FSI Spin Technology, which features wider spacing between the crosses for a tighter grip on the ball. From the baseline, the Pure Aero Team feels explosive and accurate. Although it lacks the stability of the standard Pure Aero, this racquet's raw speed translates into very easy shot making. Ultimately, this update to the Pure Aero Team checks all the right boxes. The softer feel is a nice bonus. Intermediate players looking to play aggressive tennis should start here.",

With its extended length, powerful beam construction, and open string pattern, the Pure Drive Plus gives aggressive players the ability to overwhelm their opponents with heavy pace. In addition to giving you extra leverage on groundies, this racquet’s extended length translates into an unmistakable boost in power on serves. Although not as nimble as the standard Pure Drive at net, this extended-length racquet comes around surprisingly fast in the front court, making it a formidable all-court weapon. For 2025, Babolat adds its NF2 Tech 2.0, which uses flax fibers in the throat to dampen harsh vibrations (a welcome feature, considering the stiff beam). This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the string bed to transfer more energy to the ball. Other features include Babolat’s HTR System, a layup strategy that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but creates more stability and less frame noodling on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, this update keeps a good thing going. Although you’ll appreciate the enhanced dampening and comfort, the star of the show remains its dangerous combination of power and spin. ",

From the baseline, this stick is not only fast enough for whipping up spin or resetting the point with an outstretched flick, it also gives you the advantage of a near-even balance, which helps keep the racquet more stable (and comfortable) through impact. The user-friendly combination of speed and stability continues at net where the Pure Aero Rafa comes around fast to deliver a wonderfully solid feel for its weight class. In addition to Babolat's iconic Aeromodular Beam and Woofer Grommet system, this racquet comes with FSI Spin Technology, which features wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Rafa is not only perfect for the intermediate player looking to go on offense, it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker looking for a lighter spec with fewer tradeoffs in the stability department.",

         "The Babolat Pure Strike 98 18x20 is a low powered racquet designed for players with full strokes and fast swings. It features a stiffness rating of 63.0 and a graphite composition. The racquet has a 332.0 ounce swing weight, a 98.0 square inch head size, a 11.4 ounce strung weight, and has a 18.0 by 20.0 string pattern. The racquet has a tension range of 48.0 pounds (lbs) to 57.0 pounds (lbs). The racquet has an average beam width of 21.666666666666668, with a 13.0 inch balance point, and is 4.0 head heavy. The racquet has a White/Coral colorway and has a price of 174.3 dollars. Here is the marketing blurb for the Babolat Pure Strike 98 18x20: Babolat adds another chapter to its most control-oriented racquet. Like previous versions of the Pure Strike 98 18x20, this traditional player's racquet is defined by its dense string pattern and laser-like trajectory, making it great for driving the ball through the court. It also packs a 332 swingweight, which gives it excellent stability against heavy hitters while also rewarding strong players with enough mass-based pop to impose their will. For this update, Babolat adds FSI Control technology, which features tighter string spacing for an even more precise and predictable trajectory. To help with comfort, Babolat puts NF2-Tech (flax fibers) in the shaft while keeping the head free of dampening agents to provide more direct ball feedback. As with previous generations, this frame benefits from Control Frame Technology, which blends square and elliptical cross sections to enhance stability and ball feedback. Ultimately, with this update, Babolat keeps a good thing going. Experienced players looking for a stable racquet with phenomenal control will love this one.",

With its sub 325 swingweight, the Pure Strike 100 swings easy, and it packs more than enough spin potential to bring the ball down sharply. For this update, Babolat doubles down on control and feel by adding both a more flexible beam along with FSI Control technology, which features tighter string spacing for an even more precise and predictable trajectory.

The racquet has a 315.0 ounce swing weight, a 95.0 square inch head size, a 11.7 ounce strung weight, and has a 18.0 by 20.0 string pattern. The racquet has a tension range of 45.0 pounds (lbs) to 65.0 pounds (lbs). The racquet has an average beam width of 20.5, with a 12.59 inch balance point, and is 7.0 head heavy. The racquet has a Red! colorway and has a price of 249.99 dollars. Here is the marketing blurb for the Dunlop CX 200 Tour 18x20: Dunlop adds another chapter to its most classic and control oriented racquet. Defined by its compact 95 square inch head and flexible 20.5mm beam, the CX 200 Tour 18x20 offers laser-like precision from the baseline and outstanding touch at net. As with the previous generation, this racquet's manageable swingweight makes it one of the most user-friendly members of its class. For this update, Dunlop retools the beam, adding more of a box shape below the 10/2 axis to enhance stability, control and feel. Additional changes for 2024 include Powergrid Stringtech+, which features wider cross string spacing to enhance spin and power. Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part for the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy, a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power. With this update, Dunlop keeps a good thing going. Experienced players looking for surgical control, raw speed and great feel will love this one.",

         "The Dunlop SX 300 LS is a unkown powered racquet designed for players with unkown strokes and unkown swings. It features a stiffness rating of nan and a nan composition. The racquet has a nan ounce swing weight, a nan square inch head size, a nan ounce strung weight, and has a nan by nan string pattern. The racquet has a tension range of nan pounds (lbs) to nan pounds (lbs). The racquet has an average beam width of nan, with a nan inch balance point, and is nan equally balanced. The racquet has a nan colorway and has a price of 249.99 dollars. Here is the marketing blurb for the Dunlop SX 300 LS: Dunlop gives intermediate players an easier path to power and spin. Like the previous generation, this 2025 update to the SX 300 LS is defined by speed, power, and spin. At roughly 10.6 ounces strung and boasting a very manageable swingweight, the SX 300 LS moves through contact with remarkable speed, making it easy to load the ball with heavy pace and spin. For 2025, Dunlop widens the beam’s face at 3 and 9 o’clock to increase torsional stability and energy transfer. To help with comfort, Dunlop adds Vibroshield technology, a dampening material positioned in the shaft and head to minimize harsh impact vibrations. Dunlop also updates its Spin Boost XT grommets, which have been widened in the yoke to increase string movement for greater snapback and added ball rotation. As with the previous version, these grommets are strategically shaped and positioned to enhance spin across a wider range of impact locations. Additional technologies include Sonic Core Infinergy, a thermoplastic polyurethane in the upper hoop, to create a more comfortable and responsive feel at impact.

         " Babolat adds another chapter to the most controlled and surgical member of the Pure Aero family. Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NF² Technology which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. With some nice updates to the response, the Pure Aero 98 delivers the spin and power of a modern player's racquet but with the control and feel needed to fully engage with your targets. BASED ON ADDITIONAL SAMPLES MEASURED, THE SWINGWEIGHT WAS LOWERED FROM 327 TO 321 ON 6.13.24.

         " PLEASE NOTE: this product is for 2 Pure Aero 98 racquets, with a maximum weight difference of 1 gram.Babolat adds another chapter to the most controlled and surgical member of the Pure Aero family. Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NF² Technology which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. With some nice updates to the response, the Pure Aero 98 delivers the spin and power of a modern player's racquet but with the control and feel needed to fully engage with your targets.  ",

         "The Babolat Pure Aero 98 2-Pack 2023 is a low-medium powered racquet designed for players with medium-full strokes and medium-fast swings. It features a stiffness rating of 66.0 and a graphite composition. The racquet has a 321.0 ounce swing weight, a 98.0 square inch head size, a 11.4 ounce strung weight, and has a 16.0 by 20.0 string pattern. The racquet has a tension range of 50.0 pounds (lbs) to 59.0 pounds (lbs). The racquet has an average beam width of 22.0, with a 12.79 inch balance point, and is 6.0 head heavy. The racquet has a Black/Yellow colorway and has a price of 579.0 dollars. Here is the marketing blurb for the Babolat Pure Aero 98 2-Pack 2023: PLEASE NOTE: this product is for 2 Pure Aero 98 racquets, with a maximum weight difference of 1 gram.Babolat adds another chapter to the most controlled and surgical member of the Pure Aero family. Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NF² Technology which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. With some nice updates to the response, the Pure Aero 98 delivers the spin and power of a modern player's racquet but with the control and feel needed to fully engage with your targets.",

At under 11 ounces strung and boasting a low swingweight, the 2024 Pure Strike Team combines user-friendly speed with spin-friendly precision and great feel. As such, it is the perfect all-court weapon for the rising intermediate player. For 2024, Babolat adds FSI Control technology, which features tighter string spacing for an even more precise and predictable trajectory. To help with comfort, Babolat updates this racquet with NF2-Tech (flax fibers) in the shaft while also keeping the SMAC dampening material (SWX Pure Feel) in the mid-section of the head. As with previous generations, this frame benefits from Control Frame Technology, which blends square and elliptical cross sections to deliver a stable hitting experience with excellent ball feedback. Ultimately, with subtle updates to the feel and response, the Pure Strike Team continues to offer improving players a user-friendly entry point into the controllable power and great feel of the Pure Strike family.  ",

Named the Pure Strike 100 16x20, this racquet offers a tad more control than the 100 16x19, but it still packs enough pop to close out points. With its predictable trajectory and zippy 320 swingweight, this stick offers easy targeting from the baseline and quick handling at net. It also packs a sub-64 RA stiffness, giving it an arm-friendly feel with outstanding ball feedback. As with other members of the family, this racquet has Control Frame Technology, which blends square and elliptical cross sections to deliver a stable hitting experience with excellent ball feedback. To help with vibration dampening, Babolat adds NF2-Tech (flax fibers) to both the handle and hoop. The 100 16x20 also gives you the benefit of FSI Control technology, which tightens the string spacing for a more controlled and predictable string bed response. Ultimately, with its combination of raw speed controllable power and great feel, the 100 16x20 is a great addition to the Pure Strike family.",

It also packs a 21.5 mm box beam, giving it impressive control and feel compared to its competitors. Weighing roughly 10.9 ounces strung, the CX 200 OS is weighted for rising intermediates, but it also packs a near 320 RDC swingweight, making it attractive to more advanced ball strikers, especially if they crave the advantages of a larger head size with a big spin window. For this update, Dunlop retools the beam, adding more of a box shape below the 10/2 axis to enhance stability, control and feel. Additional changes for 2024 include Powergrid Stringtech+, which features wider cross-string spacing to enhance spin and power. Dunlop also updates the stiffness profile, adding greater flexibility on the inner part of the frame for enhanced dwell time and pocketing, while also stiffening the racquet's face for added stability and power. To help reduce harsh impact vibrations, Dunlop adds a highly elastic material (named Vibroshield) to the midsection of both the hoop and shaft. This is complemented by Sonic Core with Infinergy a uniquely pliable material applied to the 3/9 axis of the head to boost comfort and power. Ultimately, with some nice updates to the feel and response, this racquet remains a great option for the intermediate player who wants a more forgiving and powerful midplus racquet. Specs based on 1 sample ",

Dunlop has also tweaked the grommet system to help the string bed return greater energy to the ball (think power). As with the previous generation, the FX 500 benefits from Sonic Core w/Infinergy, which is added to the upper hoop to soften the feel of impact. Additional features include a Power Boost Frame Geometry which combines a speedy aerodynamic profile with a wider throat for stability. Ultimately, the FX 500 is a very formidable modern player's racquet, offering a great blend of speed, spin and power. The softer feel for 2023 is a very nice bonus.  ",

Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin.

The racquet has a Black/Yellow colorway and has a price of 299.0 dollars. Here is the marketing blurb for the Babolat Pure Aero 98 2023: Babolat adds another chapter to the most controlled and surgical member of the Pure Aero family. Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NF² Technology which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. With",

With this racquet Babolat gives beginners and recreational players the perfect tool for generating spin and power.

This racquet also gives you the advantage of an open 16x18 string pattern, making it easy to load the ball with spin. Compared to a standard 100 square inch racquet, the EVO Aero Lite packs a slightly larger hitting surface, resulting in a more forgiving and user-friendly hitting experience.

Ultimately, the EVO Aero Lite not only offers user-friendly performance to improving players, it's also an outstanding value.",

Here is the marketing blurb for the Babolat Pure Aero 98 2-Pack 2023: PLEASE NOTE: this product is for 2 Pure Aero 98 racquets, with a maximum weight difference of 1 gram.Babolat adds another chapter to the most controlled and surgical member of the Pure Aero family. Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NF² Technology which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string",

Boasting an appeal that cuts across ability levels, this modern player's racquet offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, it’s also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T. For 2025, Babolat, enhances comfort with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat to smooth out harsh vibrations. This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies",

Here is the marketing blurb for the Babolat Pure Drive Plus 2025: Babolat adds another chapter to one of the game’s most dangerous players’ racquets. With its extended length, powerful beam construction, and open string pattern, the Pure Drive Plus gives aggressive players the ability to overwhelm their opponents with heavy pace. In addition to giving you extra leverage on groundies, this racquet’s extended length translates into an unmistakable boost in power on serves. Although not as nimble as the standard Pure Drive at net, this extended-length racquet comes around surprisingly fast in the front court, making it a formidable all-court weapon. For 2025, Babolat adds its NF2 Tech 2.0, which uses flax fibers in the throat to dampen harsh vibrations (a welcome feature, considering the stiff beam). This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the string bed to transfer",

         "Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolat's HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus.",

         "The Babolat Pure Drive Team 2025 is a low-medium powered racquet designed for players with medium-full strokes and medium-fast swings. It features a stiffness rating of 69.0 and a graphite composition. The racquet has a 308.0 ounce swing weight, a 100.0 square inch head size, a 10.6 ounce strung weight, and has a 16.0 by 19.0 string pattern. The racquet has a tension range of 44.0 pounds (lbs) to 53.0 pounds (lbs). The racquet has an average beam width of 24.0, with a 12.85 inch balance point, and is 5.0 head heavy. The racquet has a Blue colorway and has a price of 269.0 dollars. Here is the marketing blurb for the Babolat Pure Drive Team 2025: The Pure Drive Team 2025 is defined by its user-friendly speed, easy power, and spin-friendly targeting. At only 10.6 ounces strung and boasting a sub-315 swingweight, this racquet, though not as stable as the standard Pure Drive, makes it easier for less advanced players to address the ball with confidence. It's also quite powerful, enabling players to overwhelm their opponents with higher levels of pace. For 2025, Babolat adds enhanced dampening with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a material technology that uses flax fibers in the throat and head to smooth out harsh vibrations (a welcome feature, considering the stiff beam). This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolat’s HTR System, a",
