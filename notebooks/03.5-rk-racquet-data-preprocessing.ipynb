         " TheÂ Pure Drive is popular for a reason. Boasting an appeal that cuts across ability levels, this modern player's racquet offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, itâs also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T. For 2025, Babolat, enhances comfort with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat to smooth out harsh vibrations. This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolatâs HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus.\nThis model is version 11 ",

Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher levels of power and spin.On the court, this racquet's explosive acceleration, easy power and spin-friendly targeting make it dangerous in the hands of an aggressive baseliner. It also packs impressive all-court mobility, making it great for charging into the front court and finishing points at net.

Named the Pure Drive 98, this speedy racquet gives experienced players a dangerous combination of spin, power and precision. What separates it from the standard Pure Drive is a slightly smaller head size along with a thinner, more flexible beam. The upshot is a racquet that not only gives you a more \"connected feel\" but also delivers a more precise and predictable launch angle. For this update, Babolat reinforces the perimeter of the head with its HTR System, resulting in a more torsionally rigid construction for added stability and power. To help soak up the harsher vibrations, Babolat puts SWX Pure Feel in the shaft. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and extra RPMs (think heavy ball).Â  Ultimately, the Pure Drive 98 is a great option for experienced players who want a powerful and spin-friendly racquet with enough control to target the lines.Â  ",

At 10 ounces strung this racquet brings the explosive speed, raw power and impressive spin-potential of the Pure Drive franchise to dedicated beginners and early intermediate players. Updated with Babolat's new HTR System, the graphite layup has been re-engineered for higher torsional rigidity, resulting in more efficient energy transfer to the ball. To help soak up the harsher vibrations of this racquet's stiff construction, Babolat has devoted more real estate in the Pure Drive's shaft to SWX Pure Feel, a thin and extremely flexible viscoelastic rubber that sits between the carbon layers. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and vicious RPMs (think easy spin).Â On groundstrokes the Pure Drive Lite swings easier than both the standard Pure Drive and Pure Drive Team, making it perfect for less advanced players, especially if they are looking to master the mechanics of power and spin. This racquet's user-friendly mobility continues at net where it glides into position with remarkable ease, making it easier for you to spring into action when opportunity knocks. The speed is also an asset on service returns where the Pure Drive Lite comes around with lightning speed to deliver impressive power and accuracy. With incremental updates to the feel and response, the Pure Drive Lite continues to be a great option for the improving player. Did we mention the easy power and spin? ",

To help soak up the harsher vibrations of this racquet's stiff construction, Babolat has devoted more real estate in the Pure Drive's shaft to SWX Pure Feel a thin and extremely flexible viscoelastic rubber that sits between the carbon layers. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and vicious RPMs (think heavy ball).Â From the baseline, the Pure Drive 107 offers a comfortably crisp response. With its generous hitting area, this stick is more comfortable and forgiving than the standard Pure Drive. In addition to its explosive acceleration and easy power, this racquet's spin-potential delivers impressive command over the ball. At net the Pure Drive 107 comes around with lightning speed to deliver above average stability for its weight class. Block volleys feel solid, and there is no struggle required to execute deep, piercing replies. This stick also shines on serve where the slightly extended length (27.2\") delivers easier power than a standard length racquet. Ultimately, with some incremental tweak to the feel, the Pure Drive 107 continues to be a great option for the player who wants the undeniable advantages that come from a larger, more user-friendly head size.

At under 10 ounces strung, this ultra maneuverable racquet is not only ideal for beginners, it should also tempt the senior doubles player who is looking to supercharge their serves, volleys and returns. In addition to its forgiving oversize head, this arm-friendly racquet has an extended 27.6\" length, resulting in extra leverage for loading the ball with power. Updated with Babolat's new HTR System, this racquet's graphite layup has been re-engineered for higher torsional rigidity, resulting in more efficient energy transfer to the ball.

It rewards medium length strokes with easy depth, and there is blistering power available on full swings. The large hitting area provides a nice margin of error, ensuring that comfort and power remain high even when contact is less than perfect. It also packs an open 16x19 string pattern with impressive spin-potential. As with the previous generation, this racquet shines at net. In addition to moving fast when the pressure is on, this racquet's large and stable hitting surface makes it easy to hit effective volleys.

         " Introducing the Pure Aero Rafa the lighter, faster companion to the Rafa Origin. At under 11 ounces strung, this stick makes it easy for intermediate players to load the ball with pace and spin. Like the heavier model endorsed by Nadal, the Pure Aero Rafa does not put a lot of technology between player and ball, resulting in a more \"connected feel\" at impact (think control). From the baseline, this stick is not only fast enough for whipping up spin or resetting the point with an outstretched flick, it also gives you the advantage of a near-even balance, which helps keep the racquet more stable (and comfortable) through impact. The user-friendly combination of speed and stability continues at net where the Pure Aero Rafa comes around fast to deliver a wonderfully solid feel for its weight class. In addition to Babolat's iconic Aeromodular BeamÂ and Woofer Grommet system, this racquet comes with FSI Spin Technology, which features wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Rafa is not only perfect for the intermediate player looking to go on offense, it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker looking for a lighter spec with fewer tradeoffs in the stability department.Â Â  ",

Like previous generations, this update is made for players who want a control-oriented racquet that has enough pop to finish points. It also has more spin potential than its 18x20 counterpart, making it easier to execute the full range of angles and trajectories. Other specs include a 330 swingweight, which not only keeps the racquet stable against higher levels of pace but also translates into impressive power on full cuts. For this update, Babolat adds FSI Control technology, which features tighter string spacing for an even more precise and predictable trajectory. To help with comfort, Babolat updates this racquet with NF2-Tech (flax fibers) in the shaft while keeping the head free of dampening agents to provide more direct ball feedback. As with previous generations, this frame benefits from Control Frame Technology, which blends square and elliptical cross sections to enhance stability and ball feedback. Ultimately, with subtle updates to the feel, the Pure Strike 98 16x19 remains a great option for experienced players looking for a stable racquet with controllable power and great feel.Â Â  ",

As the lightest and fastest member of the Pure Strike family, this 10.7 ounce racquet is ideal for the intermediate player who wants controllable power, easy access to spin and great feel. Like the previous generation, it has a hybrid frame construction (called Control Frame Technology), which blends the control and feel of square beam with the speed and dynamism of a modern elliptical beam. This racquet also has FSI Power technology which features wider spacing between the upper cross strings for easier access to spin and pace. New to this frame is C2 Pure Feel, a material technology that combines cortex with a uniquely flexible viscoelastic rubber at 3/9 o'clock for added comfort and dwell time. On groundstrokes, the Pure Strike Team feels crisp, spin-friendly and accurate, with very predictable results on full swings. It's also quite fast, making it great for scrambling on defense or cranking winners on the run. The maneuverability continues on volleys and service returns where the Pure Strike Team glides into position with remarkable ease. As with the heavier Pure Strike models, the Team has great touch for hitting malicious droppers or working the ball into tight spaces. Ultimately, this is a great option for those who want a light and user-friendly performance racquet with easy targeting from all areas of the court. ",

Like the 2022 model it replaces, this racquet features the thinnest beam and most surgical head size in the Black Ace franchise. It also packs one of the softest, most flexible beams this side of the wood era, giving it the kind of buttery feedback that is rare for a modern racquet. For 2025, the layup gets updated with a groundbreaking Aurealian carbon weave, resulting in a more consistent response while also enabling tighter manufacturing tolerances. Complementing this innovation is FlexLogic, allowing the racquet to bend in ways that enhance dwell time, pocketing, and feel. This racquet also benefits from ProKennex's legendary Kinetic System, which places movable mass at 3 and 9 o'clock in the head to boost stability and comfort. Additionally, it features a Kinetic Comfort Cap, a handle technology that minimizes harsh impact vibrations. These time-tested Kinetic technologies offer one of the most arm-friendly hitting experiences available. Ultimately, the Black Ace Pro is an outstanding option for experienced players looking for the ultimate in control and feel. The fact that it allows you to play with less arm fatigue is a nice bonus.

From the baseline this racquet offers surgical targeting and great feel. Intermediates will appreciate the raw speed, making it easier to whip up heavy spin or crank winners on the run. On service returns the Black Ace comes around fast to deliver an extremely precise response. There's also enough touch on volleys to drop the ball short.

         " For 2021, ProKennex updates the Ki Q+ Tour with a sleek green cosmetic but keeps the \"best of class\" comfort and arm-safety that has defined the brand. With its thin box beam, moderate headlight balance and low stiffness rating, the Ki Q+ Tour has a wonderfully classic and controlled feel. Like the previous generation, this light player's racquet gives intermediate and advanced players impressive control and spin on full cuts. The Ki Q+ Tour features the most evolved version of Kinetic Quadfocus Technology, which deploys movable mass around multiple locations to create a more stable response. In addition to giving you greater protection from vibration, shock and racquet torque, this racquet's moveable mass puts extra horsepower under the hood, making it easier for you to dictate action with higher levels of pace. In conjunction with the arm-saving Kinetic technology in the head, this racquet's butt cap features a Comfort Cap, further enhancing protection against harsh vibrations. Other notable features include a SpiralTech Carbon layup, which removes impurities and air pockets from the graphite layers in order to provide extra strength and dampening. From the baseline, the Q+ Tour feels fast, comfortable and surgical. Stability is high for the weight. This stick also has excellent pocketing and dwell time. The whippy headlight balance will give you the easy acceleration required for spin, and the open 16x19 string pattern supplies more than enough bite for gripping the ball. But the real payoff from the baseline is the arm-friendly feel and easy power. At net this racquet comes around fast on reaction volleys, but it also does surprisingly well against pace. The exceptional touch will have you dropping the ball maliciously short. This is a must hit for the player who wants an arm-friendly control racquet with truly amazing feel and impressive maneuverability. The fact that it also has decent spin-potential is a very nice bonus. Did we mention the extra comfort and power? ",

         " Updated with a new beam design, the ProKennex Ki 5 continues its reign as one of the most arm-friendly playerâs racquets available. As with previous generations, the Ki 5 Â delivers controllable power and unparalleled comfort to intermediate players. This racquet will also tempt the advanced ball striker who wants raw speed without having to sacrifice stability. For 2022, ProKennex modernizes the beam with a trapezoidal throat design, resulting in a racquet that feels more stable through impact and transfers greater power to the ball. This racquet's defining feature is Kinetic Technology, which places movable mass around the hoop to deliver superior arm protection. Other technologies include a Comfort Cap, which adds Kinetic technology to the butt cap to attenuate residual vibrations. This Ki 5 also benefits from a Spiral Tech Carbon layup which delivers cleaner ball feedback along with less frame vibration on off-center impact. Ultimately, this impressive update is an obvious choice for any player who wants the advantages of a modern player's racquet minus the discomfort that typically plagues the breed.Â  ",

         " TheÂ Pure Drive is popular for a reason. Boasting an appeal that cuts across ability levels, this modern player's racquet offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, itâs also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T. For 2025, Babolat, enhances comfort with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat to smooth out harsh vibrations. This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolatâs HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus.\nThis model is version 11 ",

In addition to giving you extra leverage on groundies, this racquetâs extended length translates into an unmistakable boost in power on serves. Although not as nimble as the standard Pure Drive at net, this extended-length racquet comes around surprisingly fast in the front court, making it a formidable all-court weapon.

Technologies include Babolat'sÂ  HTR System, which increases the beam's torsional rigidity for more efficient energy transfer to the ball (think stability and power). To help with vibration dampening, Babolat has devoted more space in the shaft to SWX Pure Feel, a thin and extremely flexible viscoelastic rubber that sits between the racquet's carbon layers. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher levels of power and spin.On the court, this racquet's explosive acceleration, easy power and spin-friendly targeting make it dangerous in the hands of an aggressive baseliner. It also packs impressive all-court mobility, making it great for charging into the front court and finishing points at net. A must-have for collectors, this 30th Anniversary edition of the Pure Drive offers the legendary speed, spin and power that has attracted generations of players.Â  ",

Named the Pure Drive 98, this speedy racquet gives experienced players a dangerous combination of spin, power and precision. What separates it from the standard Pure Drive is a slightly smaller head size along with a thinner, more flexible beam. The upshot is a racquet that not only gives you a more \"connected feel\" but also delivers a more precise and predictable launch angle. For this update, Babolat reinforces the perimeter of the head with its HTR System, resulting in a more torsionally rigid construction for added stability and power. To help soak up the harsher vibrations, Babolat puts SWX Pure Feel in the shaft. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and extra RPMs (think heavy ball).Â  Ultimately, the Pure Drive 98 is a great option for experienced players who want a powerful and spin-friendly racquet with enough control to target the lines.Â  ",

At 10 ounces strung this racquet brings the explosive speed, raw power and impressive spin-potential of the Pure Drive franchise to dedicated beginners and early intermediate players. Updated with Babolat's new HTR System, the graphite layup has been re-engineered for higher torsional rigidity, resulting in more efficient energy transfer to the ball. To help soak up the harsher vibrations of this racquet's stiff construction, Babolat has devoted more real estate in the Pure Drive's shaft to SWX Pure Feel, a thin and extremely flexible viscoelastic rubber that sits between the carbon layers. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and vicious RPMs (think easy spin).Â On groundstrokes the Pure Drive Lite swings easier than both the standard Pure Drive and Pure Drive Team, making it perfect for less advanced players, especially if they are looking to master the mechanics of power and spin. This racquet's user-friendly mobility continues at net where it glides into position with remarkable ease, making it easier for you to spring into action when opportunity knocks. The speed is also an asset on service returns where the Pure Drive Lite comes around with lightning speed to deliver impressive power and accuracy. With incremental updates to the feel and response, the Pure Drive Lite continues to be a great option for the improving player. Did we mention the easy power and spin? ",

To help soak up the harsher vibrations of this racquet's stiff construction, Babolat has devoted more real estate in the Pure Drive's shaft to SWX Pure Feel a thin and extremely flexible viscoelastic rubber that sits between the carbon layers. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and vicious RPMs (think heavy ball).Â From the baseline, the Pure Drive 107 offers a comfortably crisp response. With its generous hitting area, this stick is more comfortable and forgiving than the standard Pure Drive. In addition to its explosive acceleration and easy power, this racquet's spin-potential delivers impressive command over the ball. At net the Pure Drive 107 comes around with lightning speed to deliver above average stability for its weight class. Block volleys feel solid, and there is no struggle required to execute deep, piercing replies. This stick also shines on serve where the slightly extended length (27.2\") delivers easier power than a standard length racquet. Ultimately, with some incremental tweak to the feel, the Pure Drive 107 continues to be a great option for the player who wants the undeniable advantages that come from a larger, more user-friendly head size.

At under 10 ounces strung, this ultra maneuverable racquet is not only ideal for beginners, it should also tempt the senior doubles player who is looking to supercharge their serves, volleys and returns. In addition to its forgiving oversize head, this arm-friendly racquet has an extended 27.6\" length, resulting in extra leverage for loading the ball with power.

It rewards medium length strokes with easy depth, and there is blistering power available on full swings. The large hitting area provides a nice margin of error, ensuring that comfort and power remain high even when contact is less than perfect. It also packs an open 16x19 string pattern with impressive spin-potential. As with the previous generation, this racquet shines at net. In addition to moving fast when the pressure is on, this racquet's large and stable hitting surface makes it easy to hit effective volleys. With its extended 27.6\" length, it not only hits lethal overheads, but it give you an undeniable power boost on serve.

With some impressive updates to the feel and string bed, the Pure Aero Light continues to be an obvious option for improving players who are looking to rise to next level. ",

         " Introducing the Pure Aero Rafa the lighter, faster companion to the Rafa Origin. At under 11 ounces strung, this stick makes it easy for intermediate players to load the ball with pace and spin. Like the heavier model endorsed by Nadal, the Pure Aero Rafa does not put a lot of technology between player and ball, resulting in a more \"connected feel\" at impact (think control). From the baseline, this stick is not only fast enough for whipping up spin or resetting the point with an outstretched flick, it also gives you the advantage of a near-even balance, which helps keep the racquet more stable (and comfortable) through impact. The user-friendly combination of speed and stability continues at net where the Pure Aero Rafa comes around fast to deliver a wonderfully solid feel for its weight class. In addition to Babolat's iconic Aeromodular BeamÂ and Woofer Grommet system, this racquet comes with FSI Spin Technology, which features wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Rafa is not only perfect for the intermediate player looking to go on offense, it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker looking for a lighter spec with fewer tradeoffs in the stability department.Â Â  ",

Other specs include a 330 swingweight, which not only keeps the racquet stable against higher levels of pace but also translates into impressive power on full cuts. For this update, Babolat adds FSI Control technology, which features tighter string spacing for an even more precise and predictable trajectory.

This racquet also has FSI Power technology which features wider spacing between the upper cross strings for easier access to spin and pace. New to this frame is C2 Pure Feel, a material technology that combines cortex with a uniquely flexible viscoelastic rubber at 3/9 o'clock for added comfort and dwell time. On groundstrokes, the Pure Strike Team feels crisp, spin-friendly and accurate, with very predictable results on full swings. It's also quite fast, making it great for scrambling on defense or cranking winners on the run. The maneuverability continues on volleys and service returns where the Pure Strike Team glides into position with remarkable ease. As with the heavier Pure Strike models, the Team has great touch for hitting malicious droppers or working the ball into tight spaces. Ultimately, this is a great option for those who want a light and user-friendly performance racquet with easy targeting from all areas of the court. ",

With this racquet, Babolat gives beginners, early intermediates and occasional players an easy swinging racquet with impressive all-around playability. In addition to being lighter and faster than the standard EVO Drive, this stick gives you the benefit of a powerful and comfortable 104 square inch head. It also has an open 16x17 string pattern, making it a great tool for learning how to hit with more spin. As with Babolat's premium performance frames, the EVO Drive Lite has SWX EVO Feel, a thin viscoelastic rubber added to multiple locations inside the frame in order to reduce harsh vibrations. The EVO Drive Lite also benefits from Babolat's time-tested Woofer technology, a grommet system that optimizes frame-string interaction to create added dwell time (for control) along greater shock absorption (for comfort). As with Babolat's legendary Pure Drive family, this racquet has a firm Elliptic Beam, which transfers greater power to the ball while also keeping the frame more stable through impact. Ultimately, this is a great option for improving players looking for high performance at a great price.Â  ",

         " Introducing the Blade 98 16x19 v9! With this update, Wilson tweaks the frame's bending properties to deliver a slightly more stable and powerful response. But make no mistake, this racquet still packs the pinpoint precision and outstanding feel that has attracted generations of players to the Blade formula. In addition to its classic 21mm box beam and 16x19 string pattern, the Blade 98 16x19 features a sub-330 swingweight, giving it impressive speed while still delivering the needed heft to absorb and redirect the pace of big hitters. Like its predecessor, this update incorporates Direct Connect Technology, fusing the butt cap directly to the carbon fiber handle for increased stability. It also retains Wilson's FortyFive layup technology, which increases lateral flexibility to complement the explosive vertical mechanics of the modern game (think spin). New for 2024 is StableFeel technology, which introduces a slightly firmer layup for greater stability and easier access to power. Experienced ball strikers will appreciate the new Clip & Go grommet system, which not only locks down the bumper but also makes for easier grommet replacement. Ultimately, with this update, Wilson keeps a good thing going. Intermediate and advanced players looking for controllable power and outstanding feel will love this one.Â  ",

With this racquet, Babolat gives beginners, early intermediates and occasional players an easy swinging racquet with impressive all-around playability. In addition to being lighter and faster than the standard EVO Drive, this stick gives you the benefit of a powerful and comfortable 104 square inch head. It also has an open 16x17 string pattern, making it a great tool for learning how to hit with more spin. As with Babolat's premium performance frames, the EVO Drive Lite has SWX EVO Feel, a thin viscoelastic rubber added to multiple locations inside the frame in order to reduce harsh vibrations. The EVO Drive Lite W also benefits from Babolat's time-tested Woofer technology, a grommet system that optimizes frame-string interaction to create added dwell time (for control) along greater shock absorption (for comfort). As with Babolat's legendary Pure Drive family, this racquet has a firm Elliptic Beam, which transfers greater power to the ball while also keeping the frame more stable through impact. Ultimately, this is a great option for improving players looking for high performance at a great price.Â  ",

For 2021, Head has not only added some extra weight and stability, they've also given this stick a lower, more arm-friendly flex rating. As with previous versions of the Radical MP, this racquet will appeal to a broad class of intermediate and advanced ball strikers. The signature technology is Graphene 360+, which combines the stability and easy power of Graphene 360 with SpiralFibers in the lower head to enhance feel. Like the previous generation this stick has a Control String Pattern, which includes denser main strings in the center for control along with wider spacing at the margins for a more forgiving feel off-center. On groundstrokes this racquet not only delivers that old school Radical feel, it also packs enough power and spin to put your opponent on defense. In addition to giving you the stability and plow-through to redirect heavier pace, this stick is also fast enough for whipping up spin or cranking winners on the run. The Radical MP also shines at net where it comes around fast to deliver a solid feel with great touch. On serves, power comes surprisingly easy, and there is enough spin-potential to hit effective slices and kickers. Ultimately, Head has produced a very impressive update to the Radical MP. Experienced players looking for a fast yet stable racquet with controllable power should add this to their demo list.Â \nSwingweight changed from 326 to 321 based on additional samples measured ",

         " Introducing the EZONE 115 (2025)! New to the EZONE family, this racquet specializes in comfort and power. In addition to being great for beginners and those with compact strokes, the EZONE 115 will also appeal to the doubles player who wants a dangerous serve and volley weapon. Defined by its luxurious 115inÂ² head, this stick provides a generous margin of error, ensuring that comfort and performance remain high, even when contact is less than perfect. Additional features include an extended 27.5\" length for extra power on serves and groundstrokes, along with an open 16x18 string pattern, making it easy to control the power with spin. For 2025, Yonex overhauls the frame's geometry, thickening the beam in the upper hoop to enhance power and stability, while adding a groove on the inner portion of the frame to help the racquet bend optimally through impact. To further enhance comfort, Yonex adds ultra-thin and flexible fibers to the shaft (called Minolon) to dampen harsh vibrations. Yonex also continues with 2G NAMD SPEED, an advanced material innovation that helps the frame transfer more energy to the ball. The most important design feature remains the ISOMETRIC head shape, which gives this stick an undeniably more plush and responsive feel than conventionally shaped equivalents. Players looking for an ultra arm-friendly racquet with dangerous levels of power will love this new addition to the EZONE family. ",

At 10.8 ounces strung, the Twistpower is weighted for intermediates, but it also has enough stability to tempt the savvy veteran who is in the market for explosive speed. Unlike many of its competitors in the sub 11 ounce weight class, the Twistpower X100 has uniquely good feel and pocketing. The great feel comes in part from a twisted shaft design which helps the racquet bend optimally at impact. On groundstrokes the Twistpower moves through contact with remarkable ease, making it great for whipping up power or cranking winners on the run. Control is excellent thanks in part to its 16x18 string pattern, which delivers the kind of spin-potential that brings the ball down hard. At net the Twistpower delivers impressive touch for a light racquet, and the raw speed makes it perfect for reaction volleys or springing into action when opportunity knocks. This stick also shines on serve where it explodes powerfully through contact to deliver juicy levels of spin and slices that curve hard. Ultimately, the Prince Twistpower X100 is an impressive addition to the Prince racquet line-up. The combination of speed, spin, power and precision makes this an obvious choice for any intermediate player who is looking for a user-friendly modern player's racquet.  ",

At nearly 11.8 ounces strung and boasting a mid 320's RDC-swingweight, the Black Ace 315 feels a tad more stable than the 300 gram version, but it still packs enough speed for the aggressive all-court player. As part of the new Ace Station series, this racquet's synchronized technologies are designed to deliver more control and feel than racquets in the Q+ and QuadFocus lines (both more power oriented). In addition to its time-tested Kinetic Technology, which uses movable mass to increase stability and power, the Black Ace features FlexLogic to help the racquet bend optimally at impact. The upshot, according to ProKennex, is reduced head deformation at impact combined with increased dwell time, giving the shot-maker heightened command over the ball. Other notable technologies include a Kinetic Comfort Handle System which reduces harsh vibrations for a cleaner feel at impact. From the baseline the Black Ace 315 combines outstanding ball feedback with very easy targeting on full swings. It comes around fast for the weight while managing to feel stable against higher levels of pace. It's also very spin-friendly, and the touch on volleys is spot on. Aggressive servers will have enough control to swing for power. With its impressive combination of stability, precision and feel, the Black Ace 315 is an obvious choice for experienced players. ",

In addition to its surgical 98inÂ² head (think accuracy), the TF40 comes with a sub-65 RA, giving it excellent pocketing and ball feedback. Weighing over 330 grams strung, the TF40 (315g) 16x19 feels stable against higher pace while remaining fast enough for whipping up spin or reacting quickly at net. Notable features include a unique 5-sided RS Sharp Beam, which enhances stability and control,Â along with Dynacore XTC for addedÂ touch, dwell time, and pocketing. This racquet is also packed withÂ  Foam, giving it an impressively dampened and solid feel at impact. Ultimately, the TF40 (315g) 16x19 remains a perfect option for experienced players looking to combine classic control and feel with modern speed and spin.Â  ",

Notable features include a unique 5-sided RS Sharp Beam, which enhances stability and control,Â along with Dynacore XTC for addedÂ touch, dwell time, and pocketing.

         " TheÂ Pure Drive is popular for a reason. Boasting an appeal that cuts across ability levels, this modern player's racquet offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, itâs also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T. For 2025, Babolat, enhances comfort with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat to smooth out harsh vibrations. This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolatâs HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus.\nThis model is version 11 ",

With its extended length, powerful beam construction, and open string pattern, the Pure Drive Plus gives aggressive players the ability to overwhelm their opponents with heavy pace. In addition to giving you extra leverage on groundies, this racquetâs extended length translates into an unmistakable boost in power on serves. Although not as nimble as the standard Pure Drive at net, this extended-length racquet comes around surprisingly fast in the front court, making it a formidable all-court weapon. For 2025, Babolat adds its NF2 Tech 2.0, which uses flax fibers in the throat to dampen harsh vibrations (a welcome feature, considering the stiff beam). This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the string bed to transfer more energy to the ball. Other features include Babolatâs HTR System, a layup strategy that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but creates more stability and less frame noodling on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, this update keeps a good thing going. Although youâll appreciate the enhanced dampening and comfort, the star of the show remains its dangerous combination of power and spin. ",

At only 10.6 ounces strung and boasting a sub-315 swingweight, this racquet, though not as stable as the standard Pure Drive, makes it easier for less advanced players to address the ball with confidence. It's also quite powerful, enabling players to overwhelm their opponents with higher levels of pace. For 2025, Babolat adds enhanced dampening with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a material technology that uses flax fibers in the throat and head to smooth out harsh vibrations (a welcome feature, considering the stiff beam). This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolatâs HTR System, a layup strategy that stiffens the hoop to further enhance power. Intermediate players looking for a light option with explosive power and spin-friendly targeting will love this one. ",

On the court, the Pure Drive Wimbledon offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, it's also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T.

This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolat's HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus. ",

Named the Pure Drive 98, this speedy racquet gives experienced players a dangerous combination of spin, power and precision. What separates it from the standard Pure Drive is a slightly smaller head size along with a thinner, more flexible beam. The upshot is a racquet that not only gives you a more \"connected feel\" but also delivers a more precise and predictable launch angle. For this update, Babolat reinforces the perimeter of the head with its HTR System, resulting in a more torsionally rigid construction for added stability and power. To help soak up the harsher vibrations, Babolat puts SWX Pure Feel in the shaft. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and extra RPMs (think heavy ball).Â  Ultimately, the Pure Drive 98 is a great option for experienced players who want a powerful and spin-friendly racquet with enough control to target the lines.Â  ",

At 11.2 ounces strung and boasting a zippy sub-325 swingweight, this stick delivers easy acceleration from the baseline and quick handling at net. It also possesses the kind of spin-friendly precision and raw power that is dangerous in the hands of aggressive players. For 2022, in addition to a more arm-friendly flex point, Babolat adds comfort with NFÂ² Technology, which uses flax inserts in the handle and upper hoop to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin.

At under 11 ounces strung, this stick makes it easy for intermediate players to load the ball with pace and spin. Like the heavier model endorsed by Nadal, the Pure Aero Rafa does not put a lot of technology between player and ball, resulting in a more \"connected feel\" at impact (think control). From the baseline, this stick is not only fast enough for whipping up spin or resetting the point with an outstretched flick, it also gives you the advantage of a near-even balance, which helps keep the racquet more stable (and comfortable) through impact. The user-friendly combination of speed and stability continues at net where the Pure Aero Rafa comes around fast to deliver a wonderfully solid feel for its weight class. In addition to Babolat's iconic Aeromodular BeamÂ and Woofer Grommet system, this racquet comes with FSI Spin Technology, which features wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Rafa is not only perfect for the intermediate player looking to go on offense, it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker looking for a lighter spec with fewer tradeoffs in the stability department.Â Â  ",

         " With the 3rd Generation of the Pure Strike Team, Babolat delivers a more dampened feel but keeps the outstanding playability of the previous generation. As the lightest and fastest member of the Pure Strike family, this 10.7 ounce racquet is ideal for the intermediate player who wants controllable power, easy access to spin and great feel. Like the previous generation, it has a hybrid frame construction (called Control Frame Technology), which blends the control and feel of square beam with the speed and dynamism of a modern elliptical beam. This racquet also has FSI Power technology which features wider spacing between the upper cross strings for easier access to spin and pace. New to this frame is C2 Pure Feel, a material technology that combines cortex with a uniquely flexible viscoelastic rubber at 3/9 o'clock for added comfort and dwell time. On groundstrokes, the Pure Strike Team feels crisp, spin-friendly and accurate, with very predictable results on full swings. It's also quite fast, making it great for scrambling on defense or cranking winners on the run. The maneuverability continues on volleys and service returns where the Pure Strike Team glides into position with remarkable ease. As with the heavier Pure Strike models, the Team has great touch for hitting malicious droppers or working the ball into tight spaces. Ultimately, this is a great option for those who want a light and user-friendly performance racquet with easy targeting from all areas of the court. ",

The upshot is a more explosive weapon, one that is better suited to the speed, spin, and pop of the modern game.

         " TheÂ Pure Drive is popular for a reason. Boasting an appeal that cuts across ability levels, this modern player's racquet offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, itâs also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T. For 2025, Babolat, enhances comfort with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat to smooth out harsh vibrations. This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolatâs HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus.\nThis model is version 11 ",

With its extended length, powerful beam construction, and open string pattern, the Pure Drive Plus gives aggressive players the ability to overwhelm their opponents with heavy pace. In addition to giving you extra leverage on groundies, this racquetâs extended length translates into an unmistakable boost in power on serves. Although not as nimble as the standard Pure Drive at net, this extended-length racquet comes around surprisingly fast in the front court, making it a formidable all-court weapon. For 2025, Babolat adds its NF2 Tech 2.0, which uses flax fibers in the throat to dampen harsh vibrations (a welcome feature, considering the stiff beam). This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the string bed to transfer more energy to the ball. Other features include Babolatâs HTR System, a layup strategy that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but creates more stability and less frame noodling on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, this update keeps a good thing going. Although youâll appreciate the enhanced dampening and comfort, the star of the show remains its dangerous combination of power and spin. ",

         " The Pure Drive Team 2025 is defined by its user-friendly speed, easy power, and spin-friendly targeting. At only 10.6 ounces strung and boasting a sub-315 swingweight, this racquet, though not as stable as the standard Pure Drive, makes it easier for less advanced players to address the ball with confidence. It's also quite powerful, enabling players to overwhelm their opponents with higher levels of pace. For 2025, Babolat adds enhanced dampening with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a material technology that uses flax fibers in the throat and head to smooth out harsh vibrations (a welcome feature, considering the stiff beam). This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolatâs HTR System, a layup strategy that stiffens the hoop to further enhance power. Intermediate players looking for a light option with explosive power and spin-friendly targeting will love this one. ",

On the court, the Pure Drive Wimbledon offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, it's also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T.

This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolat's HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus. ",

Named the Pure Drive 98, this speedy racquet gives experienced players a dangerous combination of spin, power and precision. What separates it from the standard Pure Drive is a slightly smaller head size along with a thinner, more flexible beam. The upshot is a racquet that not only gives you a more \"connected feel\" but also delivers a more precise and predictable launch angle. For this update, Babolat reinforces the perimeter of the head with its HTR System, resulting in a more torsionally rigid construction for added stability and power. To help soak up the harsher vibrations, Babolat puts SWX Pure Feel in the shaft. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and extra RPMs (think heavy ball).Â  Ultimately, the Pure Drive 98 is a great option for experienced players who want a powerful and spin-friendly racquet with enough control to target the lines.Â  ",

         " Babolat adds another chapter to the most controlled and surgical member of the Pure Aero family. Formerly called the Pure Aero VS, the Pure Aero 98 gives big hitters a powerfully precise weapon. Compared to the standard Pure Aero, this racquet features a more compact head along with a denser string pattern and a thinner, more flexible beam. The payoff is extra control, which comes in handy on bigger cuts or when targeting the lines. That said, this stick still packs enough pop to put your opponent in check. For 2023 Babolat adds NFÂ² TechnologyÂ which uses flax inserts at 3/9 in the head to soften ball impact. Babolat also updates its FSI Spin technology with slightly tighter string spacing. The result is greater control (and confidence) when maximizing stroke speed in the service of power and spin. With some nice updates to the response, the Pure Aero 98 delivers the spin and power of a modern player's racquet but with the control and feel needed to fully engage with your targets.Â BASED ON ADDITIONAL SAMPLES MEASURED, THE SWINGWEIGHT WAS LOWERED FROM 327 TO 321 ON 6.13.24.

         " Introducing the Pure Aero Rafa the lighter, faster companion to the Rafa Origin. At under 11 ounces strung, this stick makes it easy for intermediate players to load the ball with pace and spin. Like the heavier model endorsed by Nadal, the Pure Aero Rafa does not put a lot of technology between player and ball, resulting in a more \"connected feel\" at impact (think control). From the baseline, this stick is not only fast enough for whipping up spin or resetting the point with an outstretched flick, it also gives you the advantage of a near-even balance, which helps keep the racquet more stable (and comfortable) through impact. The user-friendly combination of speed and stability continues at net where the Pure Aero Rafa comes around fast to deliver a wonderfully solid feel for its weight class. In addition to Babolat's iconic Aeromodular BeamÂ and Woofer Grommet system, this racquet comes with FSI Spin Technology, which features wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Rafa is not only perfect for the intermediate player looking to go on offense, it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker looking for a lighter spec with fewer tradeoffs in the stability department.Â Â  ",

Other specs include a 330 swingweight, which not only keeps the racquet stable against higher levels of pace but also translates into impressive power on full cuts. For this update, Babolat adds FSI Control technology, which features tighter string spacing for an even more precise and predictable trajectory.

It also moves extremely fast for its weight, making it great for whipping up spin, hitting shots on the run or reacting quickly at net. Compared to the previous generation, this update offers better pocketing along with a more plush feel off-center, especially in the upper hoop where the previous gen was a tad brassy. The Pure Strike 97 also comes with FSI Control technology, which tightens the string spacing for an even more precise and predictable trajectory. To help with comfort, Babolat adds NFÂ² TechÂ which uses flax inserts in the shaft to help dampen harsh impact vibrations. Like the previous generation, this frame benefits from Control Frame Technology, which blends square and elliptical cross sections to deliver a stable hitting experience with excellent ball feedback. Ultimately, this racquet continues to be an obvious option for experienced players who want a speedy modern player's racquet with surgical targeting and great feel. The fact that it's even more comfortable than its predecessor is a nice bonus.Â  ",

Named the Pure Strike 100 16x20, this racquet offers a tad more control than the 100 16x19, but it still packs enough pop to close out points.

With its 100 square inch head, this stick delivers a more forgiving and powerful response than the 98 16x19 but it still gives aggressive players the needed control to select ambitious targets. With its sub 325 swingweight, the Pure Strike 100 swings easy, and it packs more than enough spin potential to bring the ball down sharply. For this update, Babolat doubles down on control and feel by adding both a more flexible beam along withÂ FSI Control technology, which features tighter string spacing for an even more precise and predictable trajectory. To maximize vibration dampening and comfort, Babolat combines NF2-Tech (flax fibers) in the shaft with SWX Pure Feel (viscoelastic rubber) in the mid-section of the head. This racquet also benefits from Control Frame Technology, which blends square and elliptical cross sections to deliver a stable hitting experience with excellent ball feedback. Ultimately, with subtle updates to the feel and response, the Pure Strike 100 remains a great option for intermediate and advanced players looking for a speedy modern player's racquet with controllable power and great feel.

As the lightest and fastest member of the Pure Strike family, this 10.7 ounce racquet is ideal for the intermediate player who wants controllable power, easy access to spin and great feel. Like the previous generation, it has a hybrid frame construction (called Control Frame Technology), which blends the control and feel of square beam with the speed and dynamism of a modern elliptical beam. This racquet also has FSI Power technology which features wider spacing between the upper cross strings for easier access to spin and pace. New to this frame is C2 Pure Feel, a material technology that combines cortex with a uniquely flexible viscoelastic rubber at 3/9 o'clock for added comfort and dwell time. On groundstrokes, the Pure Strike Team feels crisp, spin-friendly and accurate, with very predictable results on full swings. It's also quite fast, making it great for scrambling on defense or cranking winners on the run. The maneuverability continues on volleys and service returns where the Pure Strike Team glides into position with remarkable ease. As with the heavier Pure Strike models, the Team has great touch for hitting malicious droppers or working the ball into tight spaces. Ultimately, this is a great option for those who want a light and user-friendly performance racquet with easy targeting from all areas of the court. ",

Compared to his RF97 Autograph, the RF 01 Pro has a slightly more forgiving head size, along with a lighter weight and thicker, more aerodynamic beam construction. The upshot is a more explosive weapon, one that is better suited to the speed, spin, and pop of the modern game. This racquet's design is appropriately named SABR, a moniker that epitomizes Federer's attacking style. It includes a powerful carbon fiber layup with Braid FORTYFIVE technology to enhance both dwell time and pocketing while helping the racquet bend in ways that complement the vertical mechanics of the modern game (think spin). It also features foam throughout the racquet to deliver a more solid feel, coupled with a reinforced shaft and yoke for more torsional stability (think less racquet flopping on volleys). Ultimately, the RF 01 Pro is not only a great snapshot of Federerâs evolution; it's also hard to put down.Â  ",

         " Introducing the RF 01 Future, the lightest member of the RF Collection. Stamped with insights from Federer's legendary career, the RF 01 Future puts the geometry and technologies of Federer's RF 01 Pro into a very maneuverable package, making it easy for dedicated beginners and early intermediate players to swing confidently. This racquet should also appeal to the junior player ready to transition to an adult-sized frame. In addition to its quick handling and arm-friendly stiffness rating, the Future packs a 98-square-inch head, providing the kind of accuracy that breeds confidence when the set score tightens. This racquet's design is appropriately named SABR, a moniker epitomizing Federer's attacking style. Under the hood, it includes a powerful carbon fiber layup with Braid FORTYFIVE technology to enhance both dwell time and pocketing while helping the racquet bend in ways that complement the vertical mechanics of the modern game. It also features foam throughout the racquet to deliver a more solid feel, along with a reinforced shaft and yoke for more torsional stability through impact (think less racquet flopping on volleys). Ultimately, the RF 01 Future gives the next generation of players a great tool for mastering stroke mechanics and rising to the next level. ",

Defined by its dense 18x20 string pattern and flexible box beam, this update delivers the laser-like targeting and phenomenal ball feedback that has drawn generations of players to the Blade family. It also packs a 330 swingweight, enabling it to comfortably redirect higher levels of pace while also giving experienced players enough mass to drive the ball through the court. As with the previous generation, the Blade 98 18x20 v9 incorporates Direct Connect Technology, fusing the butt cap directly to the carbon fiber handle for increased stability. It also retains Wilson's FortyFive layup technology, which increases lateral flexibility to complement the explosive vertical mechanics of the modern game. New for 2024 is StableFeel technology, which introduces a slightly firmer construction for greater stability and easier access to power. Experienced ball strikers will appreciate the new Clip & Go grommet system, which not only locks down the bumper but also makes for easier grommet replacement. Ultimately, with subtle updates to the feel and response, the Blade 98 18x20 v9 continues to be an obvious option for experienced players looking for control and feel.  ",

         " TheÂ Pure Drive is popular for a reason. Boasting an appeal that cuts across ability levels, this modern player's racquet offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, itâs also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T. For 2025, Babolat, enhances comfort with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat to smooth out harsh vibrations. This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolatâs HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus.\nThis model is version 11 ",

In addition to giving you extra leverage on groundies, this racquetâs extended length translates into an unmistakable boost in power on serves. Although not as nimble as the standard Pure Drive at net, this extended-length racquet comes around surprisingly fast in the front court, making it a formidable all-court weapon.

With its light weight, forgiving head size, and generous margin of error, this racquet makes it easy for beginners and early intermediate players to address the ball with confidence. It's also a great option for the aging doubles veteran looking for big power on serves and lightning speed at net. For 2025, Babolat ups the comfort with an updated version of NF 2.0 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat and head to smooth out harsh vibrations (a welcome feature, considering the stiff beam). This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolatâs HTR System, a layup strategy that stiffens the hoop to further enhance power. Ultimately, this update to the Pure Drive 107 keeps a good thing going. Players looking for user-friendly speed and ultra-easy access to power will not be disappointed. The enhanced vibration dampening for 2025 is a nice touch. ",

On the court, the Pure Drive Wimbledon offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, it's also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T. Technologies include an updated version of NF2 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat to smooth out harsh vibrations. This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolat's HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control). Ultimately, for the player who wants a lightning-fast racquet with easy access to power and spin, there are few better options than the Pure Drive. The fact that this generation is softer and more comfortable than previous versions is a very nice bonus. ",

The upshot is a racquet that not only gives you a more \"connected feel\" but also delivers a more precise and predictable launch angle. For this update, Babolat reinforces the perimeter of the head with its HTR System, resulting in a more torsionally rigid construction for added stability and power. To help soak up the harsher vibrations, Babolat puts SWX Pure Feel in the shaft. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher energy return and extra RPMs (think heavy ball).Â  Ultimately, the Pure Drive 98 is a great option for experienced players who want a powerful and spin-friendly racquet with enough control to target the lines.Â  ",

         " Introducing the Pure Aero Rafa the lighter, faster companion to the Rafa Origin. At under 11 ounces strung, this stick makes it easy for intermediate players to load the ball with pace and spin. Like the heavier model endorsed by Nadal, the Pure Aero Rafa does not put a lot of technology between player and ball, resulting in a more \"connected feel\" at impact (think control). From the baseline, this stick is not only fast enough for whipping up spin or resetting the point with an outstretched flick, it also gives you the advantage of a near-even balance, which helps keep the racquet more stable (and comfortable) through impact. The user-friendly combination of speed and stability continues at net where the Pure Aero Rafa comes around fast to deliver a wonderfully solid feel for its weight class. In addition to Babolat's iconic Aeromodular BeamÂ and Woofer Grommet system, this racquet comes with FSI Spin Technology, which features wider cross spacing for a tighter grip on the ball. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Rafa is not only perfect for the intermediate player looking to go on offense, it should also tempt the more advanced ball striker looking for a lighter spec with fewer tradeoffs in the stability department.Â Â  ",

Compared to his RF97 Autograph, the RF 01 Pro has a slightly more forgiving head size, along with a lighter weight and thicker, more aerodynamic beam construction. The upshot is a more explosive weapon, one that is better suited to the speed, spin, and pop of the modern game. This racquet's design is appropriately named SABR, a moniker that epitomizes Federer's attacking style. It includes a powerful carbon fiber layup with Braid FORTYFIVE technology to enhance both dwell time and pocketing while helping the racquet bend in ways that complement the vertical mechanics of the modern game (think spin). It also features foam throughout the racquet to deliver a more solid feel, coupled with a reinforced shaft and yoke for more torsional stability (think less racquet flopping on volleys). Ultimately, the RF 01 Pro is not only a great snapshot of Federerâs evolution; it's also hard to put down.Â  ",

         " Introducing the RF 01 Future, the lightest member of the RF Collection. Stamped with insights from Federer's legendary career, the RF 01 Future puts the geometry and technologies of Federer's RF 01 Pro into a very maneuverable package, making it easy for dedicated beginners and early intermediate players to swing confidently. This racquet should also appeal to the junior player ready to transition to an adult-sized frame. In addition to its quick handling and arm-friendly stiffness rating, the Future packs a 98-square-inch head, providing the kind of accuracy that breeds confidence when the set score tightens. This racquet's design is appropriately named SABR, a moniker epitomizing Federer's attacking style. Under the hood, it includes a powerful carbon fiber layup with Braid FORTYFIVE technology to enhance both dwell time and pocketing while helping the racquet bend in ways that complement the vertical mechanics of the modern game. It also features foam throughout the racquet to deliver a more solid feel, along with a reinforced shaft and yoke for more torsional stability through impact (think less racquet flopping on volleys). Ultimately, the RF 01 Future gives the next generation of players a great tool for mastering stroke mechanics and rising to the next level. ",

Defined by its dense 18x20 string pattern and flexible box beam, this update delivers the laser-like targeting and phenomenal ball feedback that has drawn generations of players to the Blade family. It also packs a 330 swingweight, enabling it to comfortably redirect higher levels of pace while also giving experienced players enough mass to drive the ball through the court. As with the previous generation, the Blade 98 18x20 v9 incorporates Direct Connect Technology, fusing the butt cap directly to the carbon fiber handle for increased stability. It also retains Wilson's FortyFive layup technology, which increases lateral flexibility to complement the explosive vertical mechanics of the modern game. New for 2024 is StableFeel technology, which introduces a slightly firmer construction for greater stability and easier access to power. Experienced ball strikers will appreciate the new Clip & Go grommet system, which not only locks down the bumper but also makes for easier grommet replacement. Ultimately, with subtle updates to the feel and response, the Blade 98 18x20 v9 continues to be an obvious option for experienced players looking for control and feel.  ",
